<h2><a name="WHEN_LOVE_ENSLAVES" id="WHEN_LOVE_ENSLAVES">WHEN LOVE
  ENSLAVES.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a beautiful morning of early October
in the mountain region of Virginia. The old
Fitzhugh homestead, now the property of an
Englishman who had married the only daughter
of the impoverished family and bought in
the home from creditors with good British
gold, reared its dull red sides from amid a mass
of sugar maples, larches and sycamore trees,
and seemed with its widely opened doors, to
proclaim an endless hospitality. The passer-by
caught a glimpse of rambling out-houses
whose chimneys shed lazy wreaths of smoke
from pine wood fires, and if near enough
he might have sniffed the pleasant odor of
savory cookery from the rear building where

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Aunt Rose, the old-time cook, exercised her
skill to please her epicure master, or tempt
the less robust appetite of her young mistress.</p>

<p>Mrs. Meeks stood at this moment in the
middle of the sitting-room, her arms clasped
over a broom, and her dark eyes gazing upon
the floor in front of her. But her meditations
had nothing to do with the rug where the
broom rested, nor yet with the sun-lit slope
of the Blue Ridges that extended in all their
wealth of autumn beauty in front of the open
windows.</p>

<p>She was thinking of Mr. Meeks. He had
just left the house, and as not infrequently
happened, had left the sting of sharp words
behind him. Yet, not exactly sharp, either.
Overbearing, dogmatical words, not intentionally
cutting ones, for that was not the nature
of the man; but words that, said in his tone
of command, bore heavily upon sensitive feelings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Meeks was sensitive. That was evident

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
in every line of her softly rounded face,
but the red lips that were curved in Cupid's
bow could straighten and stiffen when she
was roused into one of her rare moods of determination.
Mr. Meeks called these moods
"tantrums," although his wife always spoke
low and never lost her good manners. She
had been reared by a grandmother who was
one of the last of the Southern dames of the
<i>ancien r√©gime</i>, and would have died before
she would have condescended to a rough and
vulgar quarrel.</p>

<p>It was the opposite trait in Mr. Meeks that
hurt her. He was inclined to quarrel on
slight occasion. He had not the least idea of
his defect of temper; it was always clear to
him that he was in the right, and people who
differed from him were wrong. They quarreled
with him. If people would do what they
were told, he would never have cause to get
out of humor. This lordliness of tone did not
set ill on a man presiding at town meetings,
and explaining to badly informed clients the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
intricacies of law. In these cases, suavity
and a fine, melodious voice were the decent
coverings of an egotism that wore less disguise
when he was laying down the law to
the little woman at home.</p>

<p>It had been only an agreeable sort of masterfulness
in the courting days. Then it had
seemed to the romantic girl that yielding her
will to a tender, protecting lover gave to their
relation a delightful exclusiveness, as contrasted
with other relations. But in three
years she had learned that what from one
point of view is agreeable authority, becomes
from another point of view distasteful
restraint. Besides, the fiber of the American
woman which yields sweetly to suggestions
of warmer wraps and the reserving of dances,
is less compliant under complaints of neglected
hose or bad management of fuel.</p>

<p>Still, one could conceive of a demeanor that
would have deprived even such fault-finding of
its sting. But the most tender wifely forbearance
will bristle with resentment when such a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
slight matter as a wrongly folded white tie
calls forth allusions to a blissful and ante-marital
condition in which hired landladies
were attentive to a man's comfort; and above
all, when ill-humor allows itself the parting
shot from the doorway of a muttered "darned
fool."</p>

<p>Mrs. Meeks had watched her stout, well-set-up
husband drive away behind his handsome
bay horses to his office in town, and then fallen
into an unpleasant fit of meditation over her
morning task of putting the sitting-room in
order.</p>

<p>The suggestion of Cupid's bow had entirely
disappeared by the time she had mentally reviewed
the whole situation, and her mouth was,
as the old black servant secretly observed as
she entered, "set for a fight."</p>

<p>"Ef ever Mis' Linda gits her back up onc't,
that air Englishman better look out for hisse'f,"
old Rose had confided to a confidential
friend. "I knows the Fitzhugh blood. It
won't bear much puttin' upon, now I tells you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The old family servant was not particularly
fond of her Mis' Linda's husband, and she
looked forward to that crisis when the Fitzhugh
blood would become heated.</p>

<p>"Laws, honey," she made bold to say as
she came forward and took the broom into
her hard, muscular hands, "you go and set
down. You's got no call to worry yo'se'f no-how
'bout housewuk."</p>

<p>"But you have enough to do already, Rose,"
said Mrs. Meeks kindly, and turning her eyes,
in which tears glistened, away from the withered,
kindly old face. She dared not meet
the look of sympathy, being in that humor
when even a dignified woman may be melted
into indiscreet confidences under the temptation
of a silent, intelligent championship.</p>

<p>Old Rose, however, began to sweep with
those deft, smooth strokes that raise no dust,
and with her head bent, she talked along in a
seemingly purposeless fashion.</p>

<p>"I's an ole coon, Mis' Linda; a little extry
wuk ain't goin' to hurt me none. You take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
keer yo'se'f, honey, an' don' wuk yo' good
looks away. An' don' fret 'em away, neither.
You mus'n't wu'y yo'se'f, chile. Never was
er <i>man</i> wuth wu'yin' over. Ain't I had three
husbands? De good Laud, He tuk Jim an'
Abraham, an' den I, like a fool, tuk up wid
Josh. An' he drunk an' drunk, an' den he
cusses an' swear at me, an' me wu'kin' myse'f
like er ole hoss, and den I jes gets up an' I say,
'Josh, I don' 'low no nigger ter cuss at me!'
I says, 'You kin hev de inside of dis house
an' I'll tek de outside,' and so I comes back
ter de ole place, an' what Josh do? Why,
Josh, he sober up, an' he 'gins ter see den
w'at comes o' ugliness, an' he follow a'ter me,
an' heah he is, gard'nin' fur Mr. Meeks. But
when he comes home ter de shanty he don'
cuss at me no mo'. Bes' way is jes ter let dese
men know dere place, honey, once an' fur all."</p>

<p>After old Rose had gone out with the dust-pan,
Mrs. Meeks sat still in the rocking chair
by the window, from which she could see
quite a distance down the road; but her vision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
was turned too intensely inward to admit of
her taking any interest in the few passers-by.</p>

<p>Strange how a single sentence coming at the
right time, will have a force that tons of inopportune
advice has not. "Bes' way is jes ter
let dese men know dere place, honey, once an'
fur all." The sage, worldly-wise policy of
this ignorant colored woman, to whom mother-wit
had suggested methods culture could
scarcely have rendered more effective, struck
a chord in the heart of her mistress that would
have failed to vibrate at any other moment.
When causes of irritation are not present, one
is simply amused in listening to recitals that
piquantly set forth the temper of the subject,
but when the mind is oppressed by a sense of
long-smothered injuries, it turns a very different
aspect toward experiences that appear
similar to its own.</p>

<p>Mrs. Meeks would not have deliberately
made herself, or permitted any one else to
make comparisons between her husband and
Uncle Josh, whose outward uncouthness removed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
him leagues distant from his master.
Yet, with that gentleman's last muttered expression
smarting in her ears, she quailed at
the suggestion of a spiritual likeness between
the two beings in their antipodal tweed and
jeans. Floating in upon her disturbed mind
came a certain rude epigram which she had
heard in the kitchen years ago when, a tiny
girl, she was playing about the door, and had
remembered because it struck her as being
funny: "All men's tar off de same stick."</p>

<p>"True!" said Mrs. Meeks bitterly, the tears
falling now without disguise. "Men are all
alike. I thought Robert was different. And
our life together was to be a heaven upon
earth? Well, this is the end of it all. I cannot
stand his temper&mdash;I will not stand it!"</p>

<p>How far her resentful musings would have
extended if she had been left a while longer
in that worst of solitudes, the loneliness of
affronted dignity, is uncertain, for her tears
were suddenly checked by sounds of visitors.
A keen-eyed, vivacious, middle-aged woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
alighted at the door from an open carriage
and made her way in without ceremony.
Mrs. Meeks started up with intent to escape,
but settled back in her chair again as her
visitor entered with the little whirl and rush
that characterizes the movements of a lively,
excitable woman.</p>

<p>Her sharp black eyes took in the situation
at a glance; the half-arranged room, Mrs.
Meek's dishabille, her despondent attitude and
the traces of tears. She advanced quickly and
put out both hands, exclaiming in a voice of
mingled affection and curiosity:</p>

<p>"Linda, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Louise, for once I am sorry to see
you!"</p>

<p>These two women were lifelong friends;
friends in the sense in which Virginians
understand the term, their relations being of
the sort that involves the frankest self-disclosure,
and an immediate discussion of every
important circumstance entering into their
experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, my dear," said Louise Gourlay, in a
husky, emphatic voice, which to her torment
she could never soften, "Providence sent me
here this morning. I think too much of you
not to understand at once what ails you.
Mr. Meeks has been abusing you!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Meeks blushed and tried to look indignant,
but only succeeded in looking unhappy.</p>

<p>"There is no use in talking about it," she
said, bracing herself to encounter opposition.
"Some things ought not to be talked about.
It cannot help any. I can't go back and be
a girl again." There was a slight pause and
a struggle after control, and then she broke
out with a sob: "Oh, Louise, why did I
marry?"</p>

<p>"The good Lord only knows why any of us
marry," answered the older woman, raising her
eyes devoutly. "But I suppose the world has
to be carried on some way. It isn't so much
the marrying, after all, that's the trouble, as
the foolishness afterward. Now, dear, you remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
that I prophesied long ago that Mr.
Meeks would tyrannize over you hand and
foot, if you let him. A man can't help trying
to rule the roost&mdash;mercy, what's all that row
about?"</p>

<p>She broke off suddenly and got up to look
out of the window as sounds of a great commotion
in the garden turned the peaceful
scene without into one of those miniature
pandemoniums not uncommon in the country,
where a flock of hens follow a Robin Hood of
a spouse in his raids upon forbidden territory.</p>

<p>Robin Hood in this case was a superb black
Spanish cock with large powers of leadership,
and he had succeeded in marshaling his entire
female troop into the geranium patch before
Uncle Josh, soberly hoeing corn in the rear,
was made aware of the invasion.</p>

<p>He ambled forward, waving his hat and
shouting. Aunt Rose ran out, waving her
apron, and the daring Robin Hood, making
as much noise as both of them, strode back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and forth, protecting while at the same time
vigorously protesting against the retreat of his
flock.</p>

<p>"Mercy on us!" ejaculated Mrs. Gourlay,
"the hens are trampling over your yellow
chrysanthemums, Linda."</p>

<p>Confidences can wait, but the peril of a
cherished flower-bed is not lightly to be set
aside. Mrs. Meeks was stung into renewed
interest in the life she had been upon the
point of denouncing as utterly devoid of satisfaction.
It was impossible to sit still and
watch those lazy, awkward negroes vainly trying
to head off the stout-hearted rooster. She
went out, at first with rather a contemptuous,
indifferent air, but, as the cause of provocation
scuttled toward her she suddenly felt her indefinite
sense of wrong against a sex at large
become concentrated into fury toward this
small masculine specimen, and entered into the
chase with an ardor that soon routed him from
the field.</p>

<p>She entered the house half laughing, half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
frowning at the two darkies, who had rather
enjoyed the little excitement.</p>

<p>"Aunt Rose, you are as bad as a child,
standing giggling there! You had better be
making some little cakes for lunch. Miss
Louise will stay."</p>

<p>"Laws, Mis' Linda, I couldn't he'p myse'f.
Dat rooster, he de wuss sp'iled fowl I ebber
see. He oughter be clapped inter de pot.
He got a heap o' sense, too, but he done sp'iled
tell he jes rotten." Thus Rose, as she sauntered
back to her kitchen, to look up eggs and
sugar for her cakes. Meanwhile, Mrs. Gourlay
was saying:</p>

<p>"No, Linda, I can't stay to-day. You drive
back with me and stay all night. It's an age
since you spent the night at my house. Come,
it will do Mr. Meeks good to show him you
feel a proper resentment. It's high time you
took a stand."</p>

<p>"Stay all night?" said Linda slowly. She
felt that the significance of the act would be
greater to her husband than her adviser was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
aware. It would be dropping the old life, putting
a check upon all the sweet, confidential
relations that were so dear to both, and starting
out in a new, untried path of independence,
of separateness that might end in complete
alienation. She was a reasoning woman,
used to foreseeing consequences. Sometimes
she was impatient of the sound logical faculty
that held her impulsive disposition in check,
and longed to plunge headlong into some kind
of folly, as a child bound over by a promise
not to meddle with sweets, has spasms of temptation
which even the certainty of illness and
castor oil are hardly sufficient to restrain.</p>

<p>She got up and walked slowly toward the
door that opened into her own and her husband's
room. It was a spacious chamber,
capable of holding the belongings of two persons,
and before its wide-open fireplace filled
with small logs ready for lighting, was drawn
a great easy-chair, in which he loved to recline
in the evenings with her on a cushion at his
feet, while they watched the blaze together. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
slight, nervous shudder passed over Linda as
her dress brushed against the chair on her
way to the closet where her numerous hats
were arranged in their boxes. Mr. Meeks liked
to see his pretty wife well dressed, and no
woman in the county had such an abundance
of fine clothes. She took down a fawn-colored
wool gown and went to the dressing-case to
fasten it before the glass. A serious, tremulous
face looked back at her, a face made for
sweet looks, for happiness, but now shadowed
by the most miserable feelings a woman can
have, for "to be wroth with one we love doth
work like madness in the brain."</p>

<p>There, hanging on its pretty stand, was her
jeweled watch, his wedding gift to her. Shining
on the pin cushion were brooches and little
trinkets, every one of which marked some
pleasant episode. A vase of her favorite late
white roses gathered by his hands only the
evening before, breathed reproachful sweetness
as she hastily bent over them.</p>

<p>But Linda was a proud woman as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
a tender one. The Fitzhugh spirit had been
chafed beyond endurance; it could bear the
hurts of privation, of grief, ruin and all sufferings
inflicted by evil circumstances; it could
not submit to insult. So she named the roughness
of the man whose one great fault had to-day
come to outweigh in her mind innumerable
virtues. She called old Rose, gave a few orders
in a tone that warned the servant to preserve
silence in the midst of surprise, and then,
beside her friend who kept up a cheerful flow
of talk, moved tall and stately toward the carriage,
and gazed dry-eyed, but ah, how sadly,
at the fine old red brick dwelling half-covered
with Virginia creeper and clematis, till a turn
of the road swept it out of sight.</p>

<p>The strong black horses pranced merrily
along the road, which now on one side lay beneath
the mountain, covered with the red, yellow
and brown masses of forestry that in the
autumn glorify the earth, and in daily bleeding
beauty divert a gazer's thoughts from the cruel
frosts of night. To the left a deep gorge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
rocky and dangerous, swept to the river below.
Two vehicles, coming in opposite directions,
could barely pass each other, and the driver
who had the inside track might well bless his
luck. But secure in the skill of their black
Jehu, the two women gave no single thought
to danger, but kept up their conversation indefatigably.
John, keen and alert, pulled up his
team carefully as he heard the tramp of a horseman
rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>The horseman also slowed up, and when
alongside stopped entirely, to exchange greetings.
He was elderly and distinguished-looking,
despite his shabby, dust-covered clothing
and carelessly-cropped hair and beard. His
worn, melancholy face brightened as he swept
off his hat and made careful inquiries after the
ladies' health. Then he cantered on and the
inmates of the carriage leaned back again.</p>

<p>"Poor Colonel Thomas!" commented Mrs.
Gourlay. "I recollect when he was the first
young man in the county. He has gone all to
pieces in the last year. He was rather high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
once, but Amanda was too much for him.
Sam calls her 'Petruchio in petticoats.'"</p>

<p>Her tones smote her listener's ear as sounds
coming from afar. Poor Colonel Thomas!
Had he ever been in love with that sharp-tongued
woman? How terrible for a woman to
have upon her conscience the wreck of a man's
life. If Robert should ever come to wear that
bowed look&mdash;if instead of the proud confidence
that well became his comely Saxon features,
he should show in sunken eyes and fitful flush
the marks of that ill remedy that promises but
never brings "surcease of sorrow...." But he
was too strong, too sane; misery could never
drive him to dissipation, although it might
drive him to desperation of another sort. Her
quick fancy began to picture Robert estranged
from the woman he loved. Mentally she saw
him growing cold, gloomy and reserved&mdash;their
intimacy gone as if it had never been, and they
two, bound by unbreakable ties, aging in sight
of each other, their lives dragging on in a way
that might come to end in mutual aversion and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
disgust. She knew that Robert would construe
her going away to-day, after their cold parting,
into a determination to assert herself against
him, and still worse, to seek abroad sympathy
for that which she was bound as a loving wife
to bear in silence and to forget.</p>

<p>The proud Fitzhugh blood flamed in her
cheeks and her head flung up unconsciously.
But at the same instant there came into her
mind, as a bugle note sounds amid the horrid
discord of battle, a sentence Robert had uttered
to her once in the early days of their
love, when he had inadvertently offended her
by a careless remark: "A man is not to be
judged by one word, but by all the acts of his
life."</p>

<p>And as if in her mental struggle she had
been seeking some maxim as a guide, she fastened
upon this and repeated it over and over
to herself.</p>

<p>All this time she had been mechanically
giving outward attention to Mrs. Gourlay, although
that shrewd woman, comprehending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
her absent glance, made small exactions upon
her for reply. But seeing a sudden brightness
take the place of her friend's dull gaze, she
gave her talk more point.</p>

<p>"Sam is home, my dear. He came yesterday,
and he says he means to pay us an old-fashioned
visit. I hope the weather will keep
fine so we can have some dancing picnics. He
declares they are better fun than anything in
Philadelphia."</p>

<p>"Yes, I always liked them&mdash;when I was a
girl."</p>

<p>"What are you now, an aged woman? Nonsense,
you are even prettier than you used to
be when Sam spent his days on the road between
our place and your father's. Ah, child,
you treated Sam badly. He never got over
your marriage, poor fellow. I don't know how
he will bear meeting you to-day, without any
preparation. But men's hearts bend, they
never break; that's one comfort. Still, perhaps
you'd best not flirt too hard with him."</p>

<p>Linda started and looked squarely at her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
friend. She knew that in the code of the Virginia
matron, herself holding her girlhood's
coquetries in dear remembrance, such meetings
between old flames and mild renewals of former
admiration were perfectly harmless and
natural. But her husband would think differently.
He might believe this meeting pre-meditated
on her part; believe that she sought
diversion of a dangerous and a doubtful nature.
For she knew well, and he had guessed,
that Sam Hilton's courtship of her had been no
idle pastime, and that the young Southerner
bore the Englishman a grudge which would
make him a swift partisan if there once entered
his head the slightest suspicion that she had
reason to complain of the treatment she received.</p>

<p>Had she? Her husband was in general goodness
itself, all indulgence and kindness except
when wrought upon by outer irritating quality,
or annoyed at carelessness in herself. For she
was forgetful&mdash;not wantonly careless, but lacking
in that perfect method his good taste demanded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
He was arbitrary&mdash;yes&mdash;still, some of
the blame was hers, and if they had differences
it was her place to give in. So the wife told
herself in the quick interval between Mrs.
Gourlay's last remark, and the turning of the
carriage into the east fork of the road that
marked half the distance between the two
residences.</p>

<p>"Louise," she said in an imperative undertone,
"tell John to turn back and take me
home. I <i>must</i> go back this minute. If you
think anything of me," she added hastily, interposing
against remonstrance, "do as I ask."</p>

<p>"Now, Linda, listen to reason. If you've
made up your mind to go back and eat humble-pie&mdash;excuse
the truth&mdash;at least wait till after
dinner and Sam shall drive you back. It would
be absurd to turn back now."</p>

<p>"Louise&mdash;you don't understand my feeling.
I was wrong to come. Robert was to come
home early this evening and bring an old friend
just from England with him to stay a few days.
Think how mortifying to find me gone away!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would look badly. Still&mdash;serve him
right!"</p>

<p>"No, I was cross myself this morning&mdash;probably.
I didn't mean to tell you of our quarrel&mdash;our
<i>half</i> quarrel. But never mind talking
about it, only, please take me back. Or else
let me walk? I can walk; it's not far."</p>

<p>"Linda Fitzhugh! Well, then&mdash;John, Mrs.
Meeks has forgotten an important engagement
and we must take her straight home again.
Can you turn the carriage here?"</p>

<p>"Reckon I kin, m'm," said John sulkily, and
the horses were turned about.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gourlay glanced at her watch and said
resignedly:</p>

<p>"It will be half-past one by the time I am
back, and the children will be savage, for I
promised them I wouldn't stay long this morning.
But you always have your own way with
me, Linda. I wish you were half as spunky
with somebody else."</p>

<p>"Don't, dearest," Linda entreated, the color
rising in her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will say it. If you keep on giving in this
way to a man's temper, you'll end by not daring
to say your soul's your own."</p>

<p>"Robert is imperious, perhaps," the young
wife answered slowly. "But that is between
him and me. If I can stand it, my friends
needn't worry."</p>

<p>"My dear child, you know I don't mean to
be meddlesome. I might have recollected the
old adage about a husband and wife being a
pair of scissors, and whatever comes between
the blades gets cut. But there is a principle
involved here."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Linda, "there is a principle
involved."</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean your principles and
mine are not the same," said the elder woman,
with a little heat.</p>

<p>"Oh, yours are all right for you. But I must
conform myself to a different rule. I can't explain
it all, dear, only, right or wrong, I shall
continue to give in&mdash;as you term it&mdash;to Robert.
If he is high-tempered, there's all the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
reason why I shouldn't be. I know what he
expects of me&mdash;what he has always expected
of me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Expects you to be an angel!" broke in her
friend, "while he is&mdash;whatever he chooses."</p>

<p>"Well," answered Linda, with a brilliant
smile, "I'll be as near an angel as I can. You
don't understand. There are compensations.
Even if there is a little bitter drop now and
then, he makes me very happy. And happiness
is worth an effort."</p>

<p>"Well, well," sighed her friend, and they
both fell into silence.</p>

<p>At the porch they parted with a warmer
kiss than usual. Linda could not help feeling
that she had cast herself adrift to swim alone
henceforth in waters that might be cold and
sullen. She went into the house and took off
her hat half reluctantly. The next few hours
dragged on in unbroken dulness. About four
o'clock the bay horses dashed up and Mr. Meeks
alighted from his buggy, followed by a fine-looking,
gray-haired man who was in the midst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of remarks evidently admiring and complimentary
in their nature.</p>

<p>Mrs. Meeks stood upon the veranda, her eyes
a trifle brighter than usual, her cheeks a trifle
warmer; her head was held unconsciously a
little high, but otherwise there was no criticism
to be made upon the gracious sweetness with
which she greeted her husband and his guest.</p>

<p>"I was in a measure prepared to meet you,"
said the suave Briton. "Meeks has been treating
me to certain rhapsodies of description with
which I now perfectly sympathize."</p>

<p>"In Virginia we say that an acquaintance
begun with a compliment ends in a duel," said
Linda, smiling.</p>

<p>When the guest had been ushered upstairs
to wash off the dust of travel, Mr. Meeks put
his arm about his wife's waist. His eyes were
unshadowed by any disagreeable recollections.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart!" he said.</p>

<p>"He will never make any apologies," thought
Linda. "Well, no matter. I am glad I came
back."</p>

<p class="center">I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"Mandy's</span> jest crazy to go to New York,"
said Mrs. Powell to her friend Mrs. Thomas,
who was spending the day with her.</p>

<p>The two elderly women were "kin" in that
wide-reaching term that in Virginia stretches
out over blood relationship to the remotest
degree of fortieth cousinship. Mr. Thomas'
mother had been a Powell, and it was from the
Powells, she was accustomed to say with ill-concealed
pride, that her son Vivian got his
high spirit and his splendid eyes.</p>

<p>Amanda Powell had the identical dark brown
eyes and apparently the same high spirit.
When she was six and Vivian twelve, the two
had been used to retire from family parties</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p>anywhere from one to a dozen times in the
course of an afternoon to have it out, in the
back hallway, or in the garret, or even, when
the excitement was intense, in the "far barn,"
a dilapidated building a quarter of a mile away
from the house.</p>

<p>Vivian, even at the manly age of twelve, and
in the face of all the traditions of chivalry,
which to a Southern boy of that period exercised
a very real influence over his attitude toward
the softer sex, despite the vigilance of
his mother and aunts, who were perpetually
admonishing him to recollect that "Mandy
was little and a girl besides," Vivian was tormented
by a desire to subdue his spunky,
small cousin at any cost of time and ingenuity.
He had once made a great flourish with a hazel
switch and raised a welt on her slim bare arm,
which gave him immense satisfaction at the
moment, and haunted him remorsefully for
weeks afterwards. Amanda had promptly
pulled out a lock of his hair, and then, setting
her back against the side of the barn and gritting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
her tiny white teeth, had bidden him
"come on" in a tone ringing with belligerent
probabilities.</p>

<p>After that day a new element was added to
the attraction the two children had for each
other. Their attitude was much like that of
two unfledged chickens who have had a fight
ending in a drawn battle, and have a thirst
for satisfaction. Whoever has watched a
pair of very young roosters in the act of
combat, knows how each one makes a peck
and then draws off and stands upon the defensive,
vigilant and defiant; another peck&mdash;then
another rest, neither one giving in
or running away until some intruder parts
them.</p>

<p>Vivian and Amanda had continued upon
these terms until increasing years rendered
actual fighting impossible, and left to their
antagonistic spirits only the resource of stinging
words, and to hours of repentance the mere
interchange of shy glances and softer speech,
added to a fierce absorption of one another's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
society, which left the rest of the world completely
outside.</p>

<p>The Powell and Thomas tribe had come in
the course of time to accept the alliance between
the fighting cousins as one of the mysterious
results of the strange similarity of the
two children in looks and disposition, and all
the other young cousins had learned that these
two black-eyed friend-enemies belonged to one
another, and tolerated no interference in their
relation.</p>

<p>Both were fatherless, and so, in either case,
the young spirit that needed wise and loving
restraint, had broken through the feeble curb
of motherly fondness and gained freedom before
achieving the self-control that prevents
liberty from degenerating into license.</p>

<p>Amanda was now eighteen, and Vivian&mdash;just
home from a two-years' term at the College of
Virginia&mdash;was twenty-four. The two mothers,
sitting together that afternoon, a week after
Vivian's premature return from college, were
anxiously alive to all the possibilities smouldering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
in such a period and fanned by recent
separation and the excitement of inquiry into
the changes a couple of years had wrought.</p>

<p>I should like to dwell for a moment upon
the scene of this little motherly conference.
It was the "settin'-room" of a large, old-fashioned
mansion in central Virginia, and was one
of two ample square rooms lying on either side
of a great hall that ran straight through the
middle of the house and lost itself in a broad
porch in the rear.</p>

<p>Its newly white-washed walls were half
covered with dusky old family portraits interspersed
with bits of what Amanda called
"bric-a-brac," meaning wood-cuts from the
illustrated weeklies, brilliantly colored fans,
and bunches of ferns and grasses tied together
with ends of sash ribbon. The worn carpet
covering the middle of the floor was an ancient
and costly Axminster, and the few pieces of
furniture were of massive mahogany, the long
sofa and two armchairs covered with black
haircloth, but overlaid with so many knitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
tidies and scarfs that their dreariness was well
concealed. In the deep, wide fireplace a big
log burned slowly this chilly April day, and on
either side of a spider-legged table drawn up
before the blaze, sat and rocked the elderly
ladies, dividing their attention between a
small decanter of Madeira and a plate of Aunt
'Liza's delicious plum cake, and the subject of
Amanda's craze to go to New York.</p>

<p>"Mandy's always had her own way about
everything up to this," said Mrs. Thomas, her
cool, pale blue eyes turning their wavering
glance upon the plump, handsome face of her
hostess, whose blooming cheeks were framed
in snowy curls and set off by a lace fichu that
came up high around the neck of her gray
merino dress and was fastened in front by a
pin made of her husband's hair woven into
the form of a bunch of grapes. The term
"motherly" described her accurately; her
cheery smile, her ponderous but quick motions,
her rich-toned voice and large, soft hands,
all made up a personnel that drew hearts to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
in affectionate confidence. She laughed in
responding to her cousin's remark, a mellow,
rippling laugh, such as you might have expected
from her.</p>

<p>"I dunno what 'u'd happen if anybody wuz
to set 'emselves up against Mandy," she said,
shaking her beautiful white curls. "And I
dunno's her way is sech a bad way. She don't
like to have anybody say what she shall do and
what she sha'n't, but give her her head and she's
generous as the day, and good-hearted. The
Powell disposition always wuz to be a leetle
wilful, but the Major and I always got along
well, and Mandy's like her pa. She was always
wild to travel, and she's not had a great
opportunity to see the world. If I could leave
home&mdash;or had anybody to take her! But I
reckon it'll have to be managed some way.
Mandy's bound to go."</p>

<p>"There's one person 'u'd be glad enough to
take her," said Mrs. Thomas. "He'd take her
anywhere she wanted to go, shore."</p>

<p>"You mean Edgar Chamblin?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know I mean Vivian, so what's the
use o' talkin' 'bout anybody else? I seen cl'ar
'nuff, Nellie, five year ago, how things wuz
goin' to be when them two growed up. It's
nater, and I dunno's we kin help it, even supposin'
we wuz to desire to."</p>

<p>A troubled look passed over Mrs. Powell's
face; passed and left no trace, as a cloud passes
over the sun. "Whatever is, is best," she had
been saying all her life, when persons about
her were complaining of fate and Providence
and ill-luck. But beneath her optimism was a
basis of sound judgment, and she always quietly
made herself sure that nothing better was
attainable before acquiescing in such arrangements
as Providence allotted.</p>

<p>"Edgar Chamblin is jest sech a young man
as I'd like to see Mandy marry," she observed
placidly. "I've nothin' ag'in Vivian&mdash;you
know I've always been as fond of him as if he
wuz my own&mdash;but put fire and tow together!
Now, Edgar's one of the kind that'd let Mandy
do jest what she pleased. He's easy-goin'.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Not but what he's sensible too, and steady.
I'd be proud to hev Mandy so well suited in a
husband as Ed'd suit her."</p>

<p>"I should think you'd know better'n to pick
out who Mandy's goin' to marry," said Vivian's
mother. "And I ain't so shore as it's the best
thing fur a woman to have a husband give in
to her every whip-stitch. Probably you dunno
what it is to have a shiftless, no-account, no-back-bone
sort o' creetur 'round under foot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord knows, all I want's my child's happiness,"
sighed good Mrs. Powell. "If she and
Vivian air fond o' one another, I'm not the one
to oppose 'em. But I can't say now as I want
it so. It stands to reason two black-eyed, high-strung
people, both proud as Lucifer, must expect
to have a stormy life together. Why,
it'd make me tremble&mdash;the idee of 'em goin'
away on a weddin' tour!"</p>

<p>"Vivian's a good boy, Nellie," answered his
mother in a tone that trembled a little. "You
know, yourself, he's a gentleman. No woman
need be afeard of a man if he's a gentleman."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear, the Major wuz a gentleman; no
man more so. But I dunno what'd happened
if I hadn't known how to manage him. You've
either got to manage a man or <i>be</i> managed,
and though there air women that need managin',
and some that like it, I've never seen the
man yet that's fit to be the head o' woman.
I ain't sayin' they don't exist. I haven't been
about much. But my mother had. She'd
been everywhere. Her father was Commander
in the Navy, as you know, and she said to me
once: 'Nellie, I never yet see the man that
was good enough for a good woman.' I don't
go as fur as that. Ma was ruther high in her
notions. But on the other hand it'd go mighty
hard with me to have to stand by and see a
man that married Mandy with his hand on top."</p>

<p>"Seems to me you needn't be afeard o' that
if she has Vivian. It's been all along with
them two that if one wuz ahead one day,
t'other was shore to git ahead the next. You
recollect the old saying: 'Pull Dick, pull
deevil,' I reckon, Nellie?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the worst on it. I'm mortal afeard
they'd kill one another. They ain't noways
suited, Jane, and I trust to mercy that the
thing's not to be."</p>

<p>Mrs. Powell pronounced her ultimatum with
unusual energy, and rising, began to stir about
the room, setting cushions and folding up
pieces of sewing in a manner that evinced a
wish to shake off a disagreeable impression.
Never before had she felt a wish to fight the
inevitable. She was not one of the thin-skinned,
superstitious beings who claim to be
intuitional, and she was content, ordinarily, to
recognize events when they actually took place,
and not spy them out beforehand in the clouds
of fancy. But mothers seem to have a special
sense that warns of coming danger, and this
good mother had felt within the last few
minutes a strange sinking at the heart in connection
with thoughts of Mandy which made
her very anxious and, as she put it, "fidgety," so
that to sit still longer and discuss the matter
of this undesired marriage was an impossibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"I sort o' hoped you wouldn't be averse to
the children's comin' together, Nellie," were
Mrs. Thomas's parting words as she settled
herself in the broad carryall while the sun was
still high, to drive the two miles to Bloomdale,
where, standing back a little way from Main
Street, was the modern brick house that her
father, the general storekeeper "in town," had
left her and to her eldest son George after her,
the entail taking no account of Vivian, to whom
she promptly gave up his father's farm the day
he came of age.</p>

<p>As she took up the reins after this plaintive
remark and turned her eyes reproachfully upon
Mrs. Powell's countenance, beaming upon the
parting guest from the broad doorway, another
vehicle whirled around the curve and stopped,
and two beautiful pairs of dark eyes smiled
upon her, as Vivian himself sprang out and put
his arm about Amanda with a zeal that was
totally unnecessary to the furthering of that
active damsel's descent to the ground.</p>

<p>"Where have you two been all this blessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
afternoon, when I needed Mandy to hem them
table-cloths?" said Mrs. Powell, her beaming
countenance contradicting her complaint, as
Amanda put both arms about her neck and
kissed her with an affection that was as genuine
as it was spontaneous.</p>

<p>"Been to Bear's Den," said Amanda, a rich
color mantling her opal-tinted cheeks, and a
shy, saucy smile curving a mouth formed for
the torment of men, in more senses than one.
Her voice was a modified edition of her
mother's, lazy, rich and sweet, but with keener
timbre. Under provocation it might become
scornful, which Mrs. Powell's could not. She
was tall and symmetrically built, her figure already
showing the luxurious development that
to girls of northern race comes only with an uncomfortable
embonpoint. But there was not
a trace of clumsiness in her make-up, which
united energy and languor in singularly equal
proportions.</p>

<p>A fair picture the little group made, when
Vivian had placed himself beside his young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
kinswoman and stood, leaning against the pillar,
his soft hat dangling from one hand, while
the other surreptitiously held Amanda's under
cover of her shawl. He was her match in
beauty and very like her, but with lighter
coloring, his mother's blonde tints reappearing
in his ruddy skin and bronze-brown mustache.
With equal fire of glance, there was yet something
that was not present in her spirited countenance;
a hint of petulance and selfishness.
But it was counter-balanced by a wonderful
tenderness of expression that now spread over
his clear-cut features like a wave of moonlight,
bringing out the rare charm that made Vivian
at times irresistible.</p>

<p>His mother, watching him with all her heart
in her eyes, caught her breath and dropped
the reins on her lap as she met the significant
look he turned toward her for a second, before
bending his gaze, filled with its utmost persuasive
power, upon Mrs. Powell.</p>

<p>"I reckon," he said slowly, his tones cutting
the air decisively, yet quivering with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
certain plaintiveness that recalled "Cousin
Jane's" tremulous minor notes, "this is as
good a time as any to tell you both that
Amanda and I have made up our minds to try
housekeeping together at Benvenew."</p>

<p>"After we come back from New York," put
in Amanda with a saucy glance of reminder.</p>

<p>"Children," said Mrs. Powell, more solemnly
than she had ever spoken in her life. She took
a hand of each and looked from one to the
other, while Jane Thomas scarcely breathed as
she leaned out of the carryall toward them.
"Children, if ye've both made up your minds,
I've got no call to interfere with young folks'
happiness, and I sha'n't. What I say now, I
say once and for all, and I sha'n't harp on it.
But I know both on ye pretty nigh as well as
I know myself. I'm afeard my girl needs
somethin' you can't give her, Vivian. You
think you don't, honey," she added, squeezing
the soft palm laid in her own, and longing for
eloquence to express the meaning that was in
her heart; "but you ain't a woman yet;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
you're only a child. And what you're a-goin'
to turn out depends more'n you can think now,
on the kind of marriage you make. I pity the
man that sets his heart on makin' you over to
suit himself. And you, my dear boy, air too
rash&mdash;you ain't settled enough. And it's my
duty to say, fur your own sake, that if you two
try gettin' along together, you'll be ridin' over
to your mother or to me some day with a
mouthful of complaints 'gainst Mandy. And
some of 'em 'll be just. There's a soft streak
in Mandy and there's a hard streak, and I'm
afeard you'll find the hard one."</p>

<p>"Why, mother!" said Amanda, astonished
and a little alarmed at her jolly mother's grave
discourse. The words meant nothing to her
then. She turned a laughing glance upon her
lover, who had listened with equal lack of
comprehension. Now they with one accord
drew closer together. Certainly, any advice
which does not harmonize with the wishes of
those matrimonially inclined is as the voice of
one crying in the wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"We always meant to be married, Aunt
Nellie," answered Vivian after a short pause.
"No other girl would suit me, and she is
satisfied with me. Arnt you, Mandy?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Amanda without hesitation.</p>

<p>"Nellie," cried Mrs. Thomas, unable to contain
herself any longer, "don't you make 'em
feel you don't believe they'll be happy together.
They ain't children now, and because
they've always been sparrin' is all the more
reason they'll settle down tame enough."</p>

<p>"I should just hate a man I couldn't have a
good quarrel with, once in a while," the girl
made a pretense of whispering to her mother,
and giving Vivian a look which meant that he
was to understand they were to have things as
they wanted them.</p>

<p>"I've got no call to say any more," said
Mrs. Powell, to whom this slight opposition
had been an extraordinary effort. She felt
that conscience could demand no more of her.
So she kissed Amanda and then kissed Vivian,
and Jane Thomas kissed them both and cried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
over them, as sentimental women cry when
they get their heart's desire, and they all stood
on the porch together for a few minutes, talking
eagerly, perhaps to cover a little feeling
that had been stirred up by the discussion; a
foreboding that could not quite be laid to rest,
whether, after all, this marriage was a wise one,
a prudent one, and one from which good was
to come.</p>

<p>Did Amanda feel this doubt? Perhaps the
odd little shiver that came over her and that
she shook off so lightly was a premonition she
would have done well to heed, instead of turning,
as she did, to lay her beautiful head on
her lover's shoulder in a manner that was
rather too deliberate to be altogether fond.</p>

<p>Did Vivian experience any fear of the future
in this instant of promised fulfilment of his
hopes? Not he. The time was as yet far
distant when that buoyant glance which seemed
to challenge fate was to be turned downward
in melancholy resignation, and the impetuous
outleaping of suggestion and comment that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
was natural to his enthusiastic temperament
become hesitating appeal to one he feared to
displease.</p>

<p>And the two mothers, watching this adored
son and daughter and rejoicing in their joy,
sympathizing and admiring with that admiration
which is most perfectly free from envy,
did their knowledge of human nature and
their past experience not suggest that which
must make them tremble in regarding these
two heedless young creatures, both children
of one haughty race, bent upon gratifying
that impulse of mutual attraction which was
more than likely to have its source in animal
obstinacy than in reasonable, human affection?</p>

<p>But how limited is the outlook of elderly
women in these little southern villages, where
the history of a few lives constitutes their entire
equipment in sociology, and to whom the
idea of essential differences between sets of
conditions superficially alike, can never present
itself strongly. Mrs. Powell's motherly instinct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
had had its spasm of alarm, but had been
quieted by the soothing reflection that marriage
tames high spirits, and that the Rubicon
of matrimony once passed, adjustment to circumstances
<i>must</i> follow. Nothing else was
conceivable. As for Jane Thomas, any picture
of a future into which trouble might come
to her son even from the "curse of a granted
prayer" was beyond her imagination. All she
had asked in life since Vivian was born was
that he might have whatever was necessary to
make him happy, and that spirited youth had
succeeded in convincing her that happiness
lay in having what he wanted. He wanted
Amanda, and now he had got her. Mrs.
Thomas rejoiced as far as her melancholy temperament
permitted, and trusted the future to
Providence. And in a month Amanda Powell
had become "young Mrs. Thomas." A month
is a short engagement in Virginia, but Vivian
was impatient to open up his closed homestead,
and start the farm going according to some new
theories of farming, which chiefly took shape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
in patent fertilizer and an improved kind of
harrow; also, the introduction of white labor
to supersede the "lazy darkies."</p>

<p>And to Amanda marriage meant the pretty
pearl ring her lover had placed upon her finger,
the rustling white silk gown her mother
had made for her in Ryburg, and&mdash;the wedding
journey. Our wildest dreams are only
re-combinations of what we have experienced
or read of, and how could this girl of eighteen,
for all her rich and varied nature, dream of
the coming of responsibilities that would
shake her frail fancies of married life like an
earthquake, or of mental development that
would awaken critical faculties to the extent
of making her rebel against what she now
accepted as matters of course; nothing better
having presented itself to her mind?</p>

<p>She was satisfied that the wedding was conventionally
correct, according to Fauquier
County standards; that the day was bright;
that she looked her best, and that Vivian was
devoted without being uncomfortably demonstrative.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
For without at all understanding why
it was so, the young girl, so full of ardor in all
her attachments, had a virginal coldness toward
her young lover that made her shrink with distaste
from caresses and put aside any suggestion
of an intimacy other than had always existed
between them, and of which she foresaw merely
an extension, not a transformation into anything
more exacting.</p>

<p>Reared by an old-fashioned southern mother,
watched and shielded as maidens once were
when maternal ideas of duty included an anxious
supervision over a daughter's reading,
amusements, and associations, Amanda was in
all essentials still a child, with only her natural
dignity and womanly instinct to protect
her amid the various perplexities and temptations
the future might hold for her.</p>

<p>New York burst upon her eager senses as the
first deafening crash of a full orchestra might
salute the ears of a music-mad boy who had
never heard anything more stimulating than
the wheezy strains of a second-rate melodeon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Stunned but delighted, she gazed from the carriage
windows upon the crowds, the stores, and
the elevated railway, and thought that now she
was seeing the world.</p>

<p>Vivian went to the Windsor, and as the
youthful pair descended to the dining-room
about seven o'clock and told a servant at the
door that they wanted "supper," the lofty head
waiter in condescending admiration, swooped
down and led them to the extreme rear of the
room, where, ranged in close proximity, were
four other bridal couples as newly made as
themselves.</p>

<p>But Amanda had come down in a white lawn
gown profusely trimmed with pink satin ribbon,
and heavy gold bracelets on her arms, bare to
the elbow. The other brides wore walking
suits and bonnets, with the exception of one,
whose gown was of rich brocade, and whose
supercilious face was set off by the most unapproachable
coiffure Amanda had ever seen.</p>

<p>She had quick perceptions, and was keenly
alive to any defect in her own appearance, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
in ten minutes she suffered all the agony that
would be felt by a finished woman of the world
who had inadvertently worn full dress to a
reception demanding bonnets. Yet, to the
first test her metal rang true. With heightened
color she went through the form of dining,
and Vivian, whose sensibilities were as keen
as hers and whose self-love was greater, took
note of certain differences between his young
wife and the other women, and felt himself
aggrieved by her lack of taste. It was too
soon, and he was too tender toward her for him
to betray intentionally this slight annoyance.
But an admitted cause of irritation is like the
first rip in one's apparel; every movement that
touches the rent extends it until the garment
falls into rags.</p>

<p>Vivian had permitted himself the latitude of
secret fault-finding, and from this to the next
step it was easy.</p>

<p>Their first quarrel came within a week. The
wonder is not that it came so soon, but that it
was deferred so long. Yet, the immediate cause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
was absurdly trivial. They had arranged to
drive to Clairmont and lunch in company with
some friends of Vivian. But when the morning
came he felt averse to carrying out the
program. Perhaps his head ached, or he had
slept ill, or the discovery that his trunk key was
missing annoyed him unduly. But anyway he
was out of tone.</p>

<p>One o'clock found him stretched out on
the couch in their room yawning discontentedly
over the <i>Herald</i>. Amanda, flitting about, suddenly
became aware when her toilet was half
made that he had not begun to get ready.</p>

<p>"If you don't hurry up I'll go off and leave
you&mdash;lazy fellow!" she cried. "They talk about
women being always the ones to keep people
waiting. I'm sure it's the other way. I'm always
ready for everything before you."</p>

<p>"I'm not going," said Vivian abruptly, directing
a scowl toward the wall paper.</p>

<p>They had now been married eight days. A
certain French author, renowned for his biting
epigrams, remarks: "I do not believe there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
ever was a marriage in the world, even the
union of a tiger and a panther, which would
not pretend to perfect happiness for at least
fifteen days after the marriage ceremony."</p>

<p>In this case was neither tiger nor panther;
only a young man who had always lorded it
prettily over the women in his family, and a
girl who had been brought up to expect much
deference. Perhaps in France it might have
taken fifteen days for the glamour to wear off.
But in America emotions exhaust themselves
rapidly. Amanda, standing with one gloved
hand stretched out before her, seemingly intent
upon fastening the buttons, had begun to
reflect.</p>

<p>"You ain't well," she observed coldly.
"Probably you ate too much pie last night."</p>

<p>Now, among the trifles that grate upon the
masculine mind, is having an indisposition
referred to gastronomic indulgence. At such
times a man is apt to consider that a wife but
poorly replaces a mother.</p>

<p>"Amanda, I wish you would learn that all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
varieties of pastry don't come under the head
of 'pie.' And I wish you wouldn't say 'ain't.'
It's deucedly countrified."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Amanda. She deliberately took
off her gloves and hat, and sat down upon an
ottoman near the couch. Her color had arisen,
and her black eyes had an ominous sparkle.
"Is there anything else you wish?" She asked
this aggressively. Her tone suggested that she
had not forgotten that episode of the fight in
the barn that lay a dozen years back. She
was quite as ready to stand upon the defensive
now as she had been then. But when
women stand sentinel their guns go off inadvertently.</p>

<p>"I should think you'd be ashamed of yourself,
Vivian Thomas!" then said Amanda. She
felt that he ought to be ashamed; that his display
of petulance had occurred at least a fortnight
too soon; that aside from the general
fact that she was in the right, as usual, he had put
himself in the exceptional attitude of ill-treating
a bride and trying to spoil her pleasure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
during the tour avowedly taken to give her
pleasure.</p>

<p>"What of?" asked Vivian, shutting his eyes.</p>

<p>"Of the way you're acting," promptly answered
Amanda. "If you were a little boy
you'd deserve a whipping. As you're supposed
to be a man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only supposed to be?" sarcastically put in
the depreciated young gentleman.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>act</i> like a man, then!" said Amanda
in a biting tone.</p>

<p>"You're acting like a shrew," he returned,
not entirely without reason, for the girl-wife
had worked herself up to quite a pretty rage.
Yet, as is plain, the blame was his, and in his
heart he knew it. But since he had evoked a
display of temper he had a mind to bring her to
the stool of repentance. As well now as later.</p>

<p>Amanda, upon her side was reminded that
Vivian's mother had spoiled him, and she fancied
that the time had come for her to establish
the supremacy over him that was essential
to the happiness of both. So mixed are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
motives that direct any one of our actions that
it is possible there lay side by side with this
lofty determination of the spirited young
woman a wish to prove her husband; to find
out if he had strength of character sufficient to
hold his own against her and bring her to the
point he evidently aimed toward, of coaxing
him into good humor. There was no suggestion
of any such weakness in her next words.</p>

<p>"It's no use to talk sense to you," she remarked,
as if considering ways and means.
"Because you haven't got common sense. Ma
always said that."</p>

<p>One can pardon reproaches provoked by the
occasion, but a deliberate accusation delivered
at second hand has the weight of society behind
it. And the affront was the greater in
this instance, in that Vivian had considered
"Aunt Nellie" his firm friend. He turned a
trifle pale, and rising to his feet began walking
slowly up and down the floor. After a few
strides he paused in front of Amanda and
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess your mother was right&mdash;if she
meant I hadn't good sense when I wanted to
marry you. I don't know as I've ever shown
myself much of a fool, otherwise."</p>

<p>And then&mdash;it was only eight days since the
ceremony, and they were both so young&mdash;somehow
the quarrel died out, and they
patched up a peace, and went to Clairmont
after all, in a great hurry, and with spirits
considerably ruffled. But neither of them
enjoyed the day.</p>

<p>After that a great many things went wrong.
There was money enough to pay their expenses
for a month or so, but none to waste;
and they wasted it. Accustomed to the use
of carriages, as a matter of course neither of
them thought of economizing in this line, until
confronted with an appalling livery-bill. They
did not know how to order a dinner <i>√† la carte</i>,
until they learned by costly experience, and
the fees they bestowed upon the servants,
although seemingly a trifle at the time, were
matters of grave moment when the sum total
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
of their expenditures for the month came
under discussion.</p>

<p>It had been the plan to remain away six
weeks, but upon the thirtieth day Vivian came
up to his wife, who was talking with some
other ladies upon the porch of the Grand
Union Hotel&mdash;they were then at Saratoga&mdash;and
said abruptly:</p>

<p>"Dear, can I speak with you a minute?"</p>

<p>Rather alarmed, Amanda accompanied him
to a retired spot, and put herself in a listening
attitude. It was an awkward minute for Vivian.
He was the soul of generosity, and nothing
gratified him more than to give to others
pleasure, when it cost him no effort. Yet here
he was in a deuce of a hole, and under the
necessity of making a humiliating explanation
to the person whom of all others he found it
hard to confess to.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Amanda, rather impatiently,
as he fidgeted about without saying anything.</p>

<p>"Well, my&mdash;dearest," said poor Vivian, with
pathos, turning out an empty pocket, "we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
in a fix. We've spent money a little too fast,
and have only this left!" And he held up to
view a five-dollar bill, and two silver quarters.</p>

<p>Amanda gave a gasp, and then collected her
mental forces. She had a fund of practical
common sense in her nature, and now when
she summoned it for the first time it responded
to call. The first impression her husband's
confidence made upon her was to arouse a
slight contempt, not attended to at the instant,
but unconsciously stored away to be used on
other occasions. When our friends gracefully
ignore our blunders and follies is it to be supposed
that they have really been blind to what
they gave no evidence of perceiving? As well
hope that the stone we flung into the wayside
stream was totally lost when the ripples ceased,
and that it found no home in the bed beneath.</p>

<p>"I have some money," said Amanda, hastily.
"Do we owe for hotel bills?"</p>

<p>"No, I've just settled up everything. It
was that opened my eyes. I had no idea I
was so nearly broke."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we can get home&mdash;I reckon&mdash;if we
start right off. I have fifty dollars that mother
gave me, the last thing. For 'extras,' she said.
Perhaps she meant this."</p>

<p>She could not help the little fling. It was
too hard to use this money, which she had reserved
for a special purpose.</p>

<p>Vivian bit his lip and turned his back for a
moment; but what was the use of making a
fuss now? He was thankful upon the whole
to get out of a bad scrape. It wouldn't be
Amanda if she didn't say something unpleasant.</p>

<p>Ah, Vivian, has it come to this already? It
seems the scars of certain little passages at
arms have not faded away.</p>

<p>Upon a warm, sunshiny day in June they
came home. Benvenew was in order, owing
to the efforts of the two mothers, and Mrs.
Powell's four-seated wagon was waiting at the
little station, and her genial face smiled a welcome
from the back seat.</p>

<p>"Darling mother!" murmured Amanda,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
yielding to the clasp of her mother's arms, and
for one instant feeling as if the past month
with its bewildering experiences, was all a wild
dream, and she a child again, careless, irresponsible,
and light hearted. The familiar
sights, of which she had been weary not long
ago, were charming; the smiles and nods from
people they met warmed a heart that had been
chilled and affrighted many times since she
had left her Virginia home. Here, in her own
clime, she was a princess, with friends to love
her and listen to her with respect and sympathy.</p>

<p>They forded a stream and came to the old
mill, standing half-buried in the marsh. Part
of the roof was off and the rank, clambering
vine of the wild grape had reached up and
hung over the sides in graceful festoons.
Their appearance started up a number of yellow
butterflies that had been fluttering over
the stream, and now rose in the air like a
shower of golden sparks.</p>

<p>"How beautiful it all is," said Amanda. "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
am glad to be home again. But where is Alex
taking us?"</p>

<p>"To Benvenew, of course," Mrs. Powell answered.
"Why, Mandy, dear, didn't you want
to go right there, or would you ruther go
home fur to-night? We thought probably
you'd both prefer&mdash;but the laws knows I'd
be glad to have you both come back with
me."</p>

<p>"Why, ma, I forgot!" said Amanda. "And
so I'm to begin my housekeeping right off. I
don't know enough about it to take care of that
big place."</p>

<p>"You'll have Ellen Digby to cook," said
Mrs. Powell anxiously, "and little Admonia."</p>

<p>"Admonia!" exclaimed Vivian, looking
around in some indignation from the front
seat. "I can't have that harum-scarum creature
on the place."</p>

<p>"You know Ellen really is a good servant,"
Mrs. Powell explained, apologetically. "And
she won't come without the child. Admonia's
twelve now, and she's really not so bad. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
can be trained. There wasn't anybody else we
could lay hands on."</p>

<p>"Never mind, ma, Admonia 'll do well
enough," interposed Amanda. "She's a funny
little thing, and I rather like her."</p>

<p>"Ex&mdash;actly!" Vivian observed, with an accent
lately acquired. "I imagine Amanda
training anybody."</p>

<p>We all have our secret pet vanities which
undiscriminating persons, seeing only our
surface beauties, are perpetually wounding.
Amanda's vanity was a wish to be acknowledged
sensible and practical. Beautiful, she
knew herself to be, and to hear of that was an
old story; but her executive ability was not yet
proved, and she was very sensitive upon this
point. And herein Vivian blundered. It did
not occur to him that he hurt her feelings by
depreciating her executive powers. He had
been used to regarding her as a pretty play-thing,
something to be petted and disciplined
alternately. That she had an ambition to be
something more was what he had not yet discovered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Perhaps the idea was one that he
would have to blindly grope his way toward;
for "we can only comprehend that of which
we have the beginnings in ourselves," and in
the handsome, suave, popular young Virginian
the germ of common sense and good judgment
was small; so very much smaller than his little
world believed it to be.</p>

<p>"Mandy is a leetle apt to spoil the young
niggers," said her peace-making mother. "But
then she wuz always so powerful fond o' children."</p>

<p>Amanda patted her mother's shoulder, while
a far-away look came into her eyes as she
fixed them on a distant hill, where the newly
plowed earth lay darkly red against the tender
sky-tints, and the sun swept down upon
one spot, covered with young wheat, and
spread over it like the caressing touch of a
golden hand.</p>

<p>She was passionately fond of children&mdash;this
fiery, tender-hearted woman, who showed so
many prickles to the grown people who approached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
her incautiously. And Vivian was
not. So much the more diplomatic, so much
the more polished, so full of gentleness toward
women and forbearance toward their troublesome
little ones&mdash;was it possible that it was he
who failed in patience and kindness, and the
forward Amanda who must be credited with
the possession of both, when helpless hands
were stretched out toward her? Fauquier
County would have shaken its head over such
a question. Fauquier County said that Vivian
Thomas was the mildest and best humored
young man in the world except when things
happened that he had a right to be angry
about; but that Amanda Powell was rather
too spunky and high-strung for any man except
a saint to get along with peaceably. For
her mother's sake&mdash;and also, a little in spite
of its preternaturally wise judgment&mdash;for the
sake of certain winning ways of her own, the
county people liked her; but Vivian, they
adored.</p>

<p>And so, overshadowed by this disadvantage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of which she was not quite unconscious, the
young wife descended from the wagon, helped
out as gracefully and tenderly as he had helped
her out of another vehicle the day we first saw
her, by her courteous husband, and entered
the door of her new home.</p>

<p>The first person they laid eyes upon was
the shock-headed, wild-eyed little creature
called Admonia, who dropped a flower-pot
she was carrying through the hall, and without
stopping to pick up the pieces, raced to
the kitchen, shouting:</p>

<p>"Mis' Mandy and Mr. Vivian done come
home, fur shore! Whoopy! Ain't I glad!
Now, we'uns gwine ter have times!"</p>

<p>Admonia was a prophet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>


<p class="center p2">II.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"Admonia!"</span> called a woman's voice, and in
a twinkling the owner followed and stopped in
the last one of the long row of outbuildings
that spread beyond the dining-room of Benvenew.</p>

<p>It was a mere shed, enclosed on three sides
and open at the end, the sky showing through
holes in the roof. The rough boarding that
answered for a floor was broken in many
places, and dirt and confusion reigned everywhere.
Upon a stool sat a shock-headed, wild-eyed
darkey girl of twenty or so, plucking the
feathers from a couple of fowls, and throwing
them upon the floor. Her heavy under-lip fell
and her eyes rolled as the imperative tones of
her mistress smote upon her ear, and she arose
quickly, a cloud of feathers falling from her
unspeakably dirty dress, and stood dangling a
half plucked fowl, her dark brown face so immersed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
in gloom that all the features seemed
to have run together, the whites of her eyes
and her broad yellow teeth giving her the
appearance of a bank of much soiled and partly
melted snow.</p>

<p>"Admonia," said her mistress, pausing in
the doorway, "where is Nellie?"</p>

<p>"Laws, Mis' Mandy, I dunno. I hain't saw
de chile sence Mr. Thomas tuk her."</p>

<p>"When was that?" Amanda's voice had a
peculiar ring which the girl recognized, and
knew the cause of. Her dusky face softened
into an expression of sympathy, and with the
fluency of her race she uttered the first consoling
thought that came into her head.</p>

<p>"Now, Mis' Mandy, honey, don' yo' tak' on&mdash;li'le
Nellie she all safe 'nuff; her pa done
tak' her wid him up ter he room on'y lettle
bit ago. She was pesterin' him ter show her
de stuffed owl what he done brung home frum
Ryburg, an' he jes tuk her wid him ter show
her. He&mdash;he all right, Mis' Mandy."</p>

<p>The last sentence was spoken in a lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
tone, and the harum-scarum girl, whom everyone
except her mother and her mistress considered
irreclaimably rough and wild, averted
her eyes from Amanda's pale face, and sitting
down again began industriously plucking her
fowls.</p>

<p>Without another word, but with one sharply
indrawn breath that left her lips white,
Amanda entered the house and ascended the
stairs. As she drew near a rear room on the
second floor sounds reached her ear that
brought a flaming color into her cheeks and
made her hasten her steps. The frightened,
sobbing tones of a little child came from behind
the closed door of her husband's room,
mingled with a half articulate but apparently
angry growl of a deep masculine voice.</p>

<p>Amanda turned the handle of the door with
an expression that boded ill for the person
who had evoked it. The door resisted her
pressure. It was locked. Then, in a second,
all the smouldering anxiety of the mother's
heart leaped into furious flame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Open this door!" she commanded. There
was no answer. The sobbing ceased.</p>

<p>"Mother!" called the child.</p>

<p>Amanda shook the door and pushed against
it with all her strength. "Open this door, or
I'll break it down!" So her grandfather might
have thundered out an order to some refractory
sailor on board his own good ship. The
only reply was an oath. The man in his sober
senses addressed by any one, especially a
woman, in such a manner, must have been
mild indeed, had he refrained from swearing.
But a mother, maddened by such fears as
lacerated this woman's heart, takes nothing
into account but her own feelings. With swift
steps she turned into her own room, brought
thence a large and heavy hammer and gave
the door the strongest blow her arms were
capable of throwing against it. Another&mdash;and
another. The lock yielded, and Amanda, holding
the hammer under her left arm, flew into
the room.</p>

<p>Could anything excuse or justify such violence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
in a wife? Would not the man who had
met force with force and turning upon her,
knocked her down, have been not only cleared
but applauded by any court in a Christian
country? And in Virginia, of all other places,
the laws are made for the protection of men;
and public sentiment is in harmony with the
State's code.</p>

<p>Vivian Thomas must then either be despised
by those of us who see him leaning against the
wardrobe in a passive attitude, while the
woman who had vowed to love, honor, and
obey him, ten years before, effected this headlong
entrance into his own sacred stronghold,
or he must be considered a saint, enduring
with superhuman patience the tantrums of a
domineering wife. The critic may take his
choice of opinions; only, let us note that the
handsome man now averting his eyes from
Amanda's scorching glance is not exactly the
frank, fresh-looking fellow who brought his
young bride to Benvenew. All the graceful
bearing, the nobility of outline, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
indescribable beauty Nature confers upon her
favorite sons, are still here. The silky brown
mustache droops over sensitive red lips with
tender, downward curves; the white brow is
placid, and the nostrils delicate and fine. But
the entire effect is different. A slight alteration
of a few details has changed everything.
The dark eyes have faded to a dull hazel, and
the whites have taken on a yellowish tinge.
The cheeks have rather too much color, the
flush extending to the nose. In a word, Vivian's
countenance, while retaining the refinement
that seems a part of the very flesh of
some organisms and independent of those
shaping forces that ennoble or mar the faces
of most people, betrayed some deterioration of
the whole man.</p>

<p>He seemed rather embarrassed than enraged
as Amanda, panting from her exertions and
trembling from the terrible tension of her
nerves, swept past him and picked up a little
girl cowering in the corner.</p>

<p>Without staying for another look or word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
she clasped the child in her arms and left the
room; the very atmosphere charged with the
contempt that emanated from her haughty
spirit and which Vivian felt, even in his dulled
condition, to the core of his being.</p>

<p>She carried the little girl to her own room,
and with hurried motions bathed her face,
changed her dress, and put on her hat and
cloak, all the while uttering low, endearing
words, and pressing tender kisses on the little
upturned face which was lovely as an angel's,
with great, dark eyes looking out from a
thicket of golden-brown curls.</p>

<p>"Are we going to grandma's, mother?"
Nellie asked, as Amanda changed her wrapper
for a black silk dress and took up her bonnet
and gloves. Once before, about a year ago,
after a scene between father and mother,
which had deeply impressed itself upon the
child's memory, she had been taken in the
carriage to her grandmother's, and had remained
there a week, her mother with her.
It had been a week of rare delight, shadowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
only by two things: her grandmother's remarkable
gravity, and the indisposition of her
adored mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, darling," Amanda answered hastily,
as she threw some things into a satchel and
arising from her kneeling posture before a
chest of drawers, left the room with her child,
locking the door behind her.</p>

<p>They went straight to the barn, where
Amanda hitched up old Queenie, her own horse,
to a rickety old phaeton, and drove out into
the yard, Admonia holding the gate open and
sniffling audibly as she muttered:</p>

<p>"Goo'bye, Mis' Mandy; goo'bye, li'le Nellie.
Wish't I wuz gwine wif ye, so I does."</p>

<p>"Be a good girl, Admonia," said her mistress,
bending down and giving the black
hand a cordial shake. "Look after things as
well as you can. You and your mother are
all I have to depend on now, you know, since
Pete is gone."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Admonia!" called Nellie's liquid
tones. "Please take care of my Bantam hen!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>With the blessed elasticity of childhood she
had already partly recovered from the distress
of the morning, and was able to entertain
charming visions of the pleasure before her.
But although there is in a child a superficial
light-heartedness, so that we are led to flatter
ourselves that its woes are soon over, it is certain
that injuries inflicted in the spirit of injustice,
sink deeply into the soul, and not
through inability to forgive, but through inability
to forget, the young heart once wounded
in the tender spot of confidence, never
again can put forth vigorous shoots of affection
toward the person who has affronted it.
Strange as it seemed to the world that in after
years Vivian Thomas' fondness for his daughter
never evoked in her any corresponding
demonstration, valid reason might have been
found by one acquainted with the experience
of this and other mornings, why Nellie always
listened to the praises bestowed upon her popular
parent with a pensive smile, and why,
in her dutiful attention to him, there was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
reserve and hesitancy widely different from
the cordiality of a relation free from doubt
and fear.</p>

<p>Mrs. Powell met them on the front porch.
She had on her sun-bonnet and gardening-gloves,
and behind her stalked Alex, armed
with her rake and hoe, his features expressing
the contempt of his stronger nature
for the woman's tools he carried, tempered
with a respectful sort of indulgence toward
the fancies of the best woman in the
world.</p>

<p>Ten years had passed lightly over Mrs.
Powell's fair countenance. At sixty she was
a handsome and vigorous old lady, the wear
and tear of life, felt only through sympathy
with the troubles of others, showing mainly
in a thinning of the silver curls over her
temples, and a few lines about her true, mild,
blue eyes.</p>

<p>Her first look told her that something was
wrong with Amanda, and without any great
strain upon her reasoning powers she understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
that the trouble had reference to little
Nellie. Nothing else brought that tense expression
to the mouth of her beautiful daughter,
nor kindled deep in her black eyes the
glare that told of unendurable suffering and
unquenchable resentment.</p>

<p>"I wuz jes' goin' to pot a few roses afore
frost gits 'em," she said, after affectionate
greetings had been exchanged. "Will ye set
out hyar on the bench awhile, honey, an' we
kin talk whilst I wurk?"</p>

<p>She hoped that in the course of a little quiet
talk Amanda's fierce mood would give way to
soothing influences, and that the injudicious
things the impulsive woman was apt to utter
when excited might remain upon this occasion
unsaid. But now, as always, the conservative
policy of the good woman only modified, but
could not repress the burning indignation of
a spirit that could easier pardon great injuries
to itself, than the slightest wrong done to one
who was incapable of self-defense.</p>

<p>Leaning her head back against the trunk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of the ancient magnolia tree her grandfather
had planted here, Amanda watched her mother
dig and fuss among the roses and listened
with slight response to her cheerful sentences,
biding her time.</p>

<p>Nellie flitted about like a humming bird,
coming every now and then to lay her little
head against her mother's arm with a caressing
touch that spoke well for the relation
between the two. She stayed to carry water
in her own tiny watering pot, when at last
her grandmother could no longer make excuse
to stop out of doors, and with a secret sigh, led
her daughter into the house.</p>

<p>"Well, honey," she said, with an attempt at
treating matters lightly. "You're not feeling
jes' right to-day. Now, try to forgit all about
whatever's been plaguin' you, and res' yo'self
on the sofa, whilst I go an' see about somethin'
nice fur dinner."</p>

<p>"No, no, mother. You know well enough
Aunt Liza don't need any suggestions about
her dinner. And I want to talk to you. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
<i>must</i>. You'll be sorry if you don't listen to
me."</p>

<p>"Don't I always listen to you, Mandy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, but you don't always listen
willingly. You seem to think that if things
are not spoken about that it's the same as if
they didn't exist. You think I'll stand things
better if I'm quiet about them."</p>

<p>"No, my dear child; dear knows I'm ready
an' willin' to hyar all you want to say if it
eases yo' mind any. But, honey, I do hate to
hyar yo' say sech hard things about yo' husband
as you've said to me before when you
wuz put out."</p>

<p>"Put out!" repeated Amanda, with scornful
emphasis. "Oh, mother, why won't you
see the thing as it is? A wife may bear with
her husband and not let anybody know what
she goes through, but a mother with a helpless
little child to defend, will be up in arms
against a brute, and if anybody says she is
wrong to take her child away from a father
that abuses her, why, they can <i>say</i> it. I know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
in my own heart what's right, and I'll not take
it out in talk. I'll act."</p>

<p>"Mandy, darlin'," pleaded her mother.
"Shorely you're exaggeratin'. Vivian's got
his faults, and fur be it frum me to defend
'em. I said to Jane Thomas, only last week,
at the Bush Meetin', that if Vivian could only
be persuaded to come up to the bench then
an' thar an' promise to leave off it'd make me
happier'n I've been since you wuz married.
And she said&mdash;I ain't tellin' you to rile you
'gainst Vivian's ma; yo' know she feels fur
him, same's I feel most fur you&mdash;says Jane;
'If Mandy'd ashow'd a leetle more fondness
Vivian he'd a been different. He always wuz
dependent on affection, an' a lovin' woman
could hev done anythin' with him. Mandy's
been cold as a stun, an' it's no wonder'&mdash;I
mean t'say she said it wuz a wonder 't he
<i>didn't</i> go after other women."</p>

<p>A hot color rushed into Amanda's cheeks,
and she spread her hands widely, with a gesture
of repulsion. "Don't take the trouble to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
try to hide it," she said in a low tone. "Do
you think I don't know what he races down to
Richmond for every month or two&mdash;and where
all the money goes to? Benvenew falling to
pieces, Nellie and I with no clothes excepting
what you give us, and he&mdash;gambler and libertine!"</p>

<p>"Mandy, Mandy, hush!" begged Mrs. Powell,
alarmed at a much more forcible expression
than Amanda had ever yet permitted herself.</p>

<p>"You know it's true, mother," Amanda
answered in a softer manner. "You and I
and his mother know all about it. Of course
Mrs. Thomas blames me, and upholds him.
If it hadn't been for her interference and continually
taking his part, I might have made
him behave himself better. I know all Fauquier
County believes he's the injured innocent.
I'm outspoken and he's deceitful. With his
soft, smooth manner outside it's not surprising
people think as they do; that my temper
drove him to drink. And then he never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
gets so far gone in public as he does at
home."</p>

<p>"Honey, that's somethin' to be thankful fur,
shorely?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Amanda with a strange
look. "Appearances are so much. Why,
even our own minister took it upon himself,
not long ago, to read me a sort of veiled
lecture about the beauty of meekness in a
woman. I'm tired&mdash;tired, tired of being eternally
misunderstood, and of this sort of 'devil
and angel' game&mdash;such as the children play&mdash;where
he's the angel and I'm the devil."</p>

<p>Mrs. Powell rocked back and forth softly, her
placid face expressing more concern than had
ever appeared there before. There was a
sustained earnestness about Amanda's bitter
outpouring different from the hysterical anger
she was used to show upon the occasions when
she and her child appeared with their traveling
bag at the Powell homestead.</p>

<p>"Dearie," she said hesitatingly, "do you
pray about it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"We had better let that subject alone,"
Amanda answered quietly. "I might hurt
your feelings, and I don't want to do that,
mother dear. Poor ma! It isn't your fault.
You didn't want me to have him."</p>

<p>"No, honey, but now you're married thar
ain't nothin' else to do but to b'ar it. Fur the
child's sake, Mandy, live as peaceable as you
kin. Think how dretful it is fur her to see
you two on bad terms with one another."</p>

<p>"The child! Yes, I should think&mdash;for her
sake," cried Amanda, her wrath flashing forth
again. "It is of <i>her</i> I'm thinking more than
anything. Vivian Thomas hasn't any more
love for his child than he has for anything outside
of his own pleasure. He even abuses
her!" And then she told of the scene of the
morning.</p>

<p>"Poor little thing&mdash;poor little darling," said
the grandmother indignantly; but adding in a
soothing tone: "After all, Mandy, you
know he is the child's father, and he maybe
didn't hurt her much."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"What right had he to even go near her
when he was in that condition? But, mother,
I tell you, it's not only when he's the worse
for liquor. I've known him strike her at other
times. He's cruel. There was always a streak
of cruelty in his nature. You won't believe it&mdash;nobody'd
think it to see him, but I tell you
he is born to impose on weaker people.
Nellie is afraid of him, and he makes her little
life miserable. I can't stand it. People have
no right to bring a child into this world and
make it miserable. It's my duty to take her
away from such a father."</p>

<p>"Yo' can't do that," said Mrs. Powell.</p>

<p>"I can. I can go away and take her with
me."</p>

<p>"Dearie, now yo're talkin' wild. Leave yo'
husband?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Amanda, vehemently. She
got up and began to pace the floor. It was
almost impossible for her to sit still, when excited,
and her mother had long since accustomed
herself to seeing her daughter moving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
back and forth with hurried yet measured steps,
her hands clasped tightly in front of her, while
she talked in tones always growing lower and
clearer as her mind became more energetic.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of this for a long time.
I took a resolution last time it&mdash;it happened,
that the next time he did anything to Nellie,
I'd shake the dust of his place from my feet.
It's not so much his drinking, mother&mdash;though
I believe any woman has a right to leave a
man that drinks, and that if there's danger of
having children by him, it's her <i>duty</i> to leave
him&mdash;but it's what he is altogether. I despise
Vivian Thomas."</p>

<p>"I wish I knowed what to say to you. I
know you ain't right, Mandy. It's a woman's
place to stay by the man she marries, through
thick and thin. 'Fur better or worse,' reck'lect."</p>

<p>"That was the old idea&mdash;the idea of people
who made up the form for the marriage ceremony.
It's a dead letter in our law to-day, and
it's a dead letter in society, too. Does anybody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
expect men and women to stay tied all
their lives to what's horrible? These are
modern times, mother."</p>

<p>"I'm afeared this comes o' that visit o' yo'n
to Chicago, to Cousin Lois' folks," lamented
her good mother. "I dunno nothin' 'bout
sech notions. But I do know somethin' 'bout
what people think in Fauquier County. A
woman that leaves her husband puts herself in
the wrong, and no matter if she's innocent as
the driven snow there's always a shadow
hangin' to her. Jes' stop and think what
folks'd say, my dear!"</p>

<p>"Aye," assented Amanda, bitterly. "I
know what they'd say well enough. But Fauquier
County isn't the world. Why, mother,
out beyond these narrow boundaries of
Virginia there's free territory where women
own their own souls, and can think for themselves.
They can even obey their own conscience
if it leads them to go against the
minister and the church."</p>

<p>Mrs. Powell raised a hand that trembled and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
put it up to her temple with a despairing
gesture. Tears, almost strangers to her gentle,
serene eyes, gathered and rolled down her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Pore Mandy," she said in a choking voice.
"You's fur and away from any ground whar I
kin meet up with you. I've knowed fur a spell
back you ain't took no interest in the church,
and I'm gre'tly afeared that's at the bottom o'
your troubles. If you desert the Lord He'll
desert you, honey. It's shore as I'm settin'
hyar."</p>

<p>Amanda had kneeled down and pressed her
mother's head against her shoulder; but as the
good woman regarded her sadly, somewhat as
she might have regarded a sinner about to be
prayed for in her congregation, a melancholy,
half-mocking smile succeeded to the concern
on the worn, handsome face upon a level with
her own.</p>

<p>"Do you think if I had worked for the fair
last month, and had gone regularly to the
sewing society all this while that it might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
have helped to make a different man of
Vivian?"</p>

<p>"Maybe not, dearie; though the Lord
wurks by means, an' we can't tell," answered
her mother, na√Øvely.</p>

<p>"Well, mother," Amanda said, "we can't
think just alike about some things. You're
good. You'd be good whether you were in
the Second Baptist Church or in Egypt squatting
before a hideous image. And I must be
myself. I must do what I think right, no matter
what other people think or say. And I
think it right to take my child away from a
father that ill-treats her, and who sets her a
frightful example in every way."</p>

<p>"Why, you wouldn't want to cast such a
slur as that on yo' daughter. People'd throw
it up to her always&mdash;that her father an'
mother didn't live together!"</p>

<p>"But if she was so much happier in other
ways that she could afford to stand the talk,
mother?"</p>

<p>"No, Mandy, no. Thar ain't no woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
that's come uv a good family and been raised
proper, an' to feel like a nice woman nat'rally
does feel, but what'd ruther suffer anything
else'n creation than to hev the finger o' scorn
pointed at her an' know she or any o' her
family'd done anything to desarve it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Powell had been wrought up to a point
where her feelings demanded expression,
and she continued with an earnestness and sincerity
that had the effect of the finest eloquence.</p>

<p>"Even if thar air what yo' call 'extenuatin'
circumstances,' you couldn't do this thing without
bringin' 'pon yo'self the very hardest trial
you could be set to endure. You couldn't be
in any company without thinkin' uneasily,
'Would these people be willin' I sh'd be
amongst 'em if they knowed how 'twas with
me?' In church you'd fancy every wurd the
preacher utters p'inted straight at you. And
let alone yo'self, what wouldn't you go through
thinkin' people wuz slightin' Nellie because o'
you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother, mother!" Amanda cried, "you mistake
me. You're exaggerating the thing. I&mdash;I
didn't mean <i>divorce</i>!"</p>

<p>"No, you don't mean it now, but it'd come
to that. I feel it in my bones," said Mrs.
Powell, solemnly.</p>

<p>"Well, now, dear, dear mother, listen to
me," her daughter pleaded. "Suppose that&mdash;finally,
that was the only way to save myself&mdash;to&mdash;to
protect myself from&mdash;suppose we were
in another place, in a northern city, where nobody
knows me?"</p>

<p>"Thar ain't no place on the face of the 'arth
so remote but what talk'd find you out."</p>

<p>"Shall we be martyrs, then, to a few old
women's tongues? Am I to take the risk of"&mdash;Amanda
bent and finished her sentence in her
mother's ear.</p>

<p>"Honey, shorely ye kin leave <i>that</i> in the
good Lord's hands!"</p>

<p>"I'd have been in a nice fix if I'd have left
it in his hands all these years," said Amanda
Thomas, with a look so skeptical and full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
accusation against something seen only in her
mind's eye, that her mother's pink color faded
and left her pretty cheeks white. "That's
where our creeds differ, mother. I believe in
not leaving things to chance."</p>

<p>"I said leavin' 'em to the Lord," the old
lady amended.</p>

<p>"It's the same thing," said Amanda, recklessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mandy, Mandy, it gives me a cold chill
fur to hear you talk so."</p>

<p>"I won't talk so, then. Heaven knows I
don't want to worry you any more than can be
helped. But let's look at this thing reasonably.
First, about Nellie. The child must and shall
have a chance for a happy, peaceful life. She
mustn't be tyrannized over, and hampered, and
kept down; she ought to be well educated and
have a fair chance in the world. And for that
she must be away from here&mdash;and away from
her father."</p>

<p>"Why, I sh'd think her pa wuz the ve'y
one to help her to an eddication. Vivian's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
smart enough, an' ain't he been to college?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he's been to college, and he can sing
sweetly, the girls say, and play the flute, and
read Horace's odes in the original, and dance
better than any other man in the county,"
said Amanda, despairingly. "But does all that
make him a good father, or fit him to supervise
Nellie's education?"</p>

<p>"I dunno what more you kin want, dear,"
answered her perplexed parent.</p>

<p>"Well! There are certain moral qualities.
We needn't go into it. To come to myself.
I'm a young woman yet, mother, only twenty-eight.
Is my whole life to be ruined for this
one mistake, made when I was a mere child,
and ignorant of the world as a baby?"</p>

<p>"You forgit. A woman's life's sp'iled if she
leaves her husband. Thar ain't no sech thing
as takin' a fresh start with a livin' husband in
the background o' your life. He'd be croppin'
up yar an' thar an' ev'ywhar, wors'n a field
o' nettles. Do you reckon Vivian's goin' to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
lose sight o' you? And, moreover, Mandy, if
you sh'd go to the dretful pass o' seekin' a divorce,
wouldn't the law give him the child?"</p>

<p>Amanda started, and bent her black brows
fiercely. This was the first argument her
mother had used that she was unable to answer.</p>

<p>"Of course the laws are all in favor of the
men. Yes, they would give my innocent darling&mdash;my
baby that is part of my own flesh and
blood, that I've nourished at my breast, that
I've suffered for and lived for these nine years&mdash;to
a besotted, selfish, immoral man who would
never fulfill one duty toward her, and who
doesn't care for her the worth of his little finger.
The only thing is that I don't believe he'd
want her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Powell shook her head. "You can't
depend on that. Men always want the last
thing you might s'pose'd be any use to 'em.
They want their own way, you see."</p>

<p>"Then the only thing I can do is to keep
it a secret where I go. There are places
enough."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"An' how'd ye git along, poor child? How'd
ye do cooped up'n some mean leetle place
without no run fur Nellie, an' without horses,
nor anybody to do a han's turn fur ye? And,
dearie, you know, even though I'd ruther you'd
stay hyar by yo' duty, wharever you go my
lov'd foller you, an' I'd always do all in my
power. But money's the one thing we don't
hev. If you're somewhar 't you hev to put yo'
han' in yo' pocket fur ev'y livin' thing, even to
an egg, or a slip o' parsley, how 'pon 'arth'll
you do?"</p>

<p>"I mean to work, dear mother. I can sew,
and embroider, and do lots of things," said
Amanda, spreading her white hands and looking
at them meditatively; not dreaming, poor,
thing, of the thousands and thousands of other
defter and more experienced hands stretched
forth in the localities she thought abounding in
lucrative work, for the merest shadow of employment,
and the paltriest sort of recompense.</p>

<p>In Mrs. Powell's imagination Amanda was a
rarely talented and capable woman, able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
perform wonders, yet her shrewd common sense
suggested difficulties that Amanda could not
but recognize when they were pointed out,
averse as she was to consider any details made
against her plan.</p>

<p>They talked over the matter from every point
of view, the elder woman reiterating the same arguments
she had used already, and the younger
one meeting them continually with that free, liberal
interpretation of the gospel of individuality
which youth has always flourished in the face
of age and conservatism.</p>

<p>Mrs. Powell held out as stanchly as only a
good, bigoted Christian woman, devoutly living
up to the public opinion of an insular, mountain
village, can hold out against modern
heresies striking at the very foundation of her
social system, and her religious beliefs. But
Amanda had been for a very long time working
herself up to her present resolution, and
she stuck to her purpose with unflinching
steadfastness, and had by supper-time succeeded
in convincing her mother that she was in deadly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
earnest and not to be dissuaded. And after
she had put Nellie into the great old-fashioned
bed and tucked the coverlet about her soft,
warm little throat, she only stayed by her long
enough to be sure that the child was sound
asleep, then kissing the curls floating out over
the pillow, with a fervent affection such as no
man had ever known from this woman with a
genius for motherhood, she stole away softly,
leaving the door ajar, and went back to the
sitting-room to talk to her mother more
definitely about the plans she had formed for
the future.</p>

<p>But hardly had the two settled down before
the fire when, with a rattle and a bang, very
unlike her old-time timidity, Jane Thomas flung
herself into the room.</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;h!" said Amanda, as the heavy door
slammed shut. "You'll wake Nellie!" She
got up and set the door partly open again, then
resumed her seat, pushing the chair away from
the hearth to make room for her mother-in-law,
but saying no word of welcome, for she felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
that this visit was made with some special disciplinary
intention toward herself.</p>

<p>If ever a woman's face and mien conveyed
indignation and resentment of the splenetic
sort, Mrs. Thomas' meager visage and thin
figure manifested these sentiments as she fell
into the chair drawn forward for her, and
turned her watery-blue eyes upon her son's
wife.</p>

<p>"Nellie!&mdash;to be shore!" she uttered in a
spiteful whimper. "Pity but what yo'd hev
a leetle consideration for other folks 'sides
that child. Hyar yo've done pitched onter
Vivian and attackted him with hammers an'
druv him out'n his own house, an' made a
scandal that'll ring through Fauquier County,
and the saints above knows what it's all
about. I thank the Lord I ain't got yo' disposition!"</p>

<p>"You've a great deal to be thankful for in
the way of disposition," observed Amanda.
She had closed her lips tightly, resolving to
maintain absolute silence; but what woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
can suppress the witty retort when her antagonist
exposes a vulnerable point?</p>

<p>"Seems ter me I'd be a leetle mo' humble,
consider'n' what yo've done. It'd become
you ter be thankful 't yo' awful temper didn't
do no mo' harm 'n it done. Not but what it
done 'nuff an' mo'n I shu'd like ter hev 'pon
my conscience."</p>

<p>"If you'd take a few of your son's sins upon
your conscience it might give you something
to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't look fur nothin' but sass from
you, 'Mandy Powell. Yo've a tongue the
devil hisself 'd fly frum."</p>

<p>"If Vivian Thomas has run from it you
must be right," answered Amanda.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thomas rocked back and forth till her
chair creaked with a spiteful sound that seemed
to her hearers to be an echo of her whining
voice. She expatiated upon the deplorable
effects of her daughter-in-law's fearful outbreak
of the morning, and warned her that no man
on earth was called on to put up with such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
tantrums, and that if she was locked up in the
lunatic asylum it would be no more than she
had a right to expect.</p>

<p>Amanda put a severe break upon her imperious
spirit and said no more words in reply
until at last Mrs. Thomas brought out her
final taunt, that she had only run away for the
purpose of getting Vivian to come after her
and bring her back; and for this time she was
mistaken. She would have to stay away a
mighty long while if she waited for him to
fetch her, and she'd be glad to creep home
again by the time everybody cried shame upon
her.</p>

<p>Then Amanda arose and stood before her
adversary, tall and majestic, with her arms
folded across her swelling chest, and her black
brows bent in such a frown as made Jane
Thomas' cowardly heart flutter, until she
thought of the impossibility of a personal encounter
with this woman, whom she would
have given half her possessions to conquer
and humiliate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"I say to you here and now," said Amanda,
using unconsciously an orotund quality of
voice that, together with her pose, rendered
her delivery so forceful that her words stamped
themselves upon the memory of both her
hearers: "I have left Vivian Thomas' roof
forever. Spread the fact as fast as you please;
gloat upon the scandal it will create in this
gossiping little place, and tear my reputation
to pieces as fast as you want to. No power
under Heaven can make me look upon that
man's face again, or pass a moment in his company!"</p>

<p>For a few seconds there was a hush in the
air, as if a missile had been thrown, and an effect
was looked for. People often experience
this momentary apprehension when some peculiarly
definite and emphatic stand has been
taken by anyone; as if definiteness, in this
changing world, was a crime to bring down
punishment.</p>

<p>But effects rarely follow so swiftly as those
that came upon the heels of Amanda's declaration.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Hardly had her voice died away when
her mother arose hastily, crying:</p>

<p>"Hark, what's that?"</p>

<p>There were sounds of dogs barking, voices
exclaiming, and the quick, irregular gallop of
a horse's feet coming up to the front porch.
The three women stood looking at each other,
when a wild figure with eyes starting out of
its head, wool standing on end, and gown half
torn from its back, burst into the room, and
Admonia cried out in a hoarse voice:</p>

<p>"Mis' Mandy, Mis' Mandy! Fur de Lawd's
sake, Mis' Mandy&mdash;Mr. Vivian done fell off'n
he's horse inter Mowbry Gulch an' b'oke he's
neck!"</p>


<p class="center p2">III.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mowbray Gulch</span> was a danger-pit lying
midway between Sampson's Tavern and Benvenew.
The road narrowed after passing
Bloomdale, and wound around the spur of the
Blue Ridges known as Round Peak, in a manner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
only a native could have understood.
Vivian had traversed the narrow bridle-path
thousands of times without a thought of danger,
galloping past at night in that spirit of
confidence characteristic of a Virginia boy, said
to be "born on horseback."</p>

<p>The accident must have occurred early in
the evening, for a passer-by on his way home
to supper found a hat and whip on the road
near the edge of the Gulch, and looking down,
discovered a man's form on the rocks, twenty
feet below, lying perfectly motionless, with a
white face upturned to the sky.</p>

<p>At least three hours had intervened between
that and Admonia's alarm, and when the three
women arrived in Jane Thomas' wagon (she
had wept, and abused her daughter-in-law all
the way) they had found many neighbors upon
the scene, and the doctor bending over something
stretched out on a mattress by the road-side.</p>

<p>"He is living," were the words they heard
as they came up, and Mrs. Thomas broke out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
into wails of thankfulness, while Mrs. Powell
breathed more quietly a prayer as grateful.
Amanda said no word, but a deep sigh exhaled
from her burdened chest, and she tried to draw
nearer. A friendly hand held her back. Edgar
Chamblin's blue eyes glimmered anxiously in
the light of the lantern he was holding, and he
said with kindly insistence:</p>

<p>"I wouldn't go nigh him jes' yet, Mis'
Mandy. We're goin' ter tote him ovah t'
cousin Evy Smith's. Her'n is the nighest
house, an' Doctor Sowers says he must be
taken ter the ve'y nighest place."</p>

<p>"Can't he be taken <i>home</i>?" wailed Vivian's
mother. "I mean to <i>my</i> house whar he kin be
taken cyar uv?" with a spiteful look at her
daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>The doctor looked up anxiously. Vivian's
closed lids had quivered for a second and a
look of consciousness appeared, then faded
away. With tender hands he was laid on the
cot that now arrived and carried over the field
to Miss Eva Smith's cottage, where the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
bedroom off the parlor had been made ready
for him, and the best bed was spread with every
dainty piece of linen the spinster could draw
from her treasured store.</p>

<p>So it was upon a lace-trimmed, hemstitched
pillow-slip that the beautiful head of the injured
man reposed, and over him was spread
a silk quilt that had long been the pride of
Miss Evy's maiden heart, and which she now
brought forth with a solemn sense of consecration.</p>

<p>Miss Evy was a thin, fragile woman, with a
figure that had once been willowy, but was now
angular; blue eyes that once were like forget-me-nots,
contrasting with tender, coral lips and
baby blond hair; but tears shed in secret had
washed the blue from her eyes and the peachy
bloom from her oval cheeks, until only a faint
reminiscence remained of the beauty which
had captivated Vivian Thomas' boyish fancy.
One of the peculiarities of Vivian's fortune was
that the women he had wooed and forsaken
remained faithful to him till death, cherishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
no resentment and seeking no retaliation; but,
instead, biding the time when by some act of
service they could prove the strength of an
affection that always had in it an element of
maternal fondness.</p>

<p>Why some men whose paths through life
are marked by the broken hearts of women
should experience from those they injure the
tenderness and leniency seldom or never accorded
to better but rougher men is something
only to be explained by the waywardness of
feminine nature. The majority of women like
to be martyred, but resent frank abuse. The
weakly child of the flock easily converts his
mother into a slave, even though she perceives
through the veil of feebleness the force of
egotism. And in the same way the man of
soft manners, winning voice, and insinuating
tongue, may play the tyrant at his pleasure, and
be admired and adored by women whose slavishness
is a conscious concession to some
imagined delicacy that appeals to their maternal
instinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>In the humble heart of Miss Evy her girlhood's
hero had maintained his place, notwithstanding
her conscientious efforts after
Vivian's marriage to think of him as something
entirely apart from her life. Thinking of him
was a privilege she allowed herself under certain
restrictions. She thought of him when
she prayed, when she sang in the choir on
Sunday and Wednesday nights, and when she
worked in her flower-garden. Most of all then,
for long ago he had been used to stop his
horse and stand outside the low stone fence,
with his arm through the bridle-rein, and talk
with her in a playfully sentimental way that
she had thought the prettiest sort of love-making.
And so, to keep him out of her mind
when she tended her spotted lilies and trained
the purple wistaria, was as impossible as it
would have been to avoid the connection between
the sky and the gracious heaven lying
beyond.</p>

<p>It was an innocent indulgence that did not
infringe upon the rights of Vivian's wife, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
did no harm to the gentle woman herself; for
it kept alive her faith in human nature and
trust in the compensations Providence has in
store for those who have been denied their
heart's desire in this world. And these are
feelings that die out in most of us under
the scourge of disappointment and leave
something worse than heartache in their
room.</p>

<p>There had been days when the loneliness of
her self-chosen, single lot had been too hard to
be borne, and sometimes then Miss Evy would
steal to the window of her little spare front
room, and peep guiltily through a slit in the
blue shade to watch for a sight of Vivian riding
past, and when the longed-for vision appeared,
she would start back with her hand on
her heart and a hot color in her delicate cheek,
but he never saw her, nor ever dreamed of her
observation. If he had he would have dismounted
and chatted with her for a few minutes
at the gate; for Vivian was ever tender
toward the women who worshiped him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
he would have valued the eloquent if silent
appreciation of this faithful heart, and taken
comfort in the sympathy she would have expressed
at least in looks; rumor having carried
to her news of scenes at Benvenew, little to
Amanda's credit.</p>

<p>As she stood back behind the door, and
watched from this little distance hands that
had a better right than her own minister to
the man she loved, a pang of jealousy sent its
jarring quiver through all her nerves; but the
next instant it was succeeded by the thankful
feeling that it was hers to extend hospitality,
to furnish the means of comfort, and mayhap,
her privilege, while others rested, to help nurse
him back to health.</p>

<p>There was something for everyone to do
that night, for the country doctor worked with
the bustle that grows out of the necessity of
finding occupation for the officious onlookers
who must not be offended. Something for
everybody excepting Jane Thomas, whose
hysterical condition made her such a nuisance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
that even Dr. Sowers could think of no more
diplomatic suggestion than that she should go
somewhere and lie down&mdash;and take some warm
water and brandy.</p>

<p>"And me a Blue Ribboner!" she moaned
resentfully.</p>

<p>Amanda was a born nurse; self-restrained,
level-headed, tender and strong, she won golden
laurels in the doctor's opinion as she quietly
took her place at his side, and intelligently
carried out his wishes without comment or
question. Her mother went home at nine
o'clock to take care of little Nellie, the doctor
having stated his opinion that although there
was concussion of the brain, Vivian's hurt
would not necessarily prove fatal. The state
of coma might be followed by brain fever, but
with good nursing his fine constitution would
bring him through.</p>

<p>"It's sartenly a special Providence," thought
Mrs. Powell, when Amanda told her that she
should stay at the cottage. "Don't you take a
mite o' fear 'bout Nellie; you know she'd stay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
with me contented fur any length o' time," she
said, as she left.</p>

<p>"But you'll bring her over to see me for a
few minutes when you come to-morrow,"
Amanda urged, and her mother answered: "Uv
coas, honey, we'll come over right 'arly. Don't
you get wore out now; you and Miss Evy take
tu'ns settin' up."</p>

<p>It had required considerable effort to induce
Mrs. Thomas to see things in the light of her
uselessness, and it was the doctor himself who
finally carried her off and left the house to Miss
Evy and Amanda. It was late when they
found themselves alone in the little room where
lay the still form of the man who was dearer
than her heart's best blood to the one woman,
and to the other&mdash;who shall say whether dear,
or no?</p>

<p>Amanda had never been in love with the
all-conquering hero of Fauquier County. At
eighteen she had been in love with love; and
Vivian was nearer the embodiment of her ideal
than any other whom she knew. The highest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
powers of our nature remain latent in most
of us for lack of opportunity to develop. It may
be a talent, it may be a virtue that stays in the
germ throughout all the ups and downs of our
career, and that we pass on to our children to
come out in them as practical capacity.</p>

<p>Although Amanda had in her nature a rare
power of wifely devotion, it was of the royal
order; it could not stoop, and so it died away.
And in its stead had grown to mighty proportions
the mother-love that extends in women
of a high type beyond the instinctive care of
her own young, to an all-embracing tenderness
toward feeble creatures of every degree. The
little ones, the helpless, the sick appealed to
this strong, self-poised woman in a way that
called out every capacity for self-sacrifice that
lay in her, and she would have wrestled with
death and all the evil powers to save from harm
anything which confided itself to her protection.</p>

<p>The vigorous, healthy Vivian, contemptuously
setting at naught her standards of duty,
and wounding her dignity in a hundred ways,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
was so repulsive to her moral sense that she was
ready to fly from him as from a pestilence.
But Vivian cast down from his height of graceful
insolence and dependent upon her kind
offices, had claims before which every critical
faculty bowed itself. All she thought of now
was how to help him.</p>

<p>"Do you think he'll come to in his right
mind?" asked Miss Evy in a low murmur, after
half an hour had passed in silence. She could
not stand it any longer. She felt as if she must
say something. That handsome, calm woman
seated at the head of the bed awed her, and at
the same time irritated her. In some vague
way she felt that Amanda was to blame for
Vivian's accident. Like Mrs. Thomas she felt
that if the wife had fallen into spasms of self-reproach
it would have been more fitting than
this display of courage and energy. Yet she
was glad, too, for his sake that there was some
one at hand able to "take holt and do whatever
wuz needed."</p>

<p>Amanda looked over at the gentle spinster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
pleasantly, but replied only by a faint shake of
the head. Her watch lay open upon the stand
beside a glass of medicine, covered with a hymn
book. Upon the book lay a thin silver spoon
marked with the initials of Miss Evy's grandmother.
It was one of six, and Miss Evy only
used them upon rare occasions.</p>

<p>Amanda still wore her black silk, and over it
she had tied one of her hostess' white aprons,
made of fine nainsook and trimmed with a deep
border of home-made lace. Aprons are the
least neutral of garments, for they have the
effect of bringing into view certain values in
their wearer. By this touchstone some women
are instantly proclaimed dowdies; others approved
as domestic, and still others marked out
as queens or fairies masquerading. The natural
servant wears her apron smartly; the born
chatelaine with an inimitable grace. Upon
Amanda's magnificent figure the garment assumed
the air of the imperial purple, and Miss
Evy, watching her meekly, acknowledged in
her successful rival some rare quality which she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
could not name, but which seemed to account
for and justify the ascendancy she was said to
exercise over all her family.</p>

<p>At midnight Vivian opened his eyes.
"Whoa, Sultan!" he uttered in feeble tones,
and made a motion with his hand as if he
pulled upon the reins. Miss Evy started, but
Amanda laid her finger on her lips and bending
over him, said softly:</p>

<p>"Drink this, Vivian," putting a glass to his
lips. He drank all she gave him eagerly, then
his head fell back upon the pillow, and he slept
till dawn.</p>

<p>Miss Evy was persuaded to retire toward
morning. She would have preferred to sit there
and watch, but she could not say so, and she
was compelled to steal away upstairs, and leave
Vivian to his wife, who kept unwinking vigil
until the first glimmer of light shot through the
closed blinds of the east window. Then she
arose and put out the lamp, and noiselessly raising
the window let the pure, fresh mountain air
into the little room. During her watchful night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
her mind had been entirely occupied with
Vivian's condition; she had not thought of
herself. But now, as the sun touched the tip
of Round Peak and crept downward till the
whole valley was illumined with the light of a
perfect October day, she became conscious, with
a thrill of pain, of that feeling of personal life
and identity which is so strong and vivid when,
in some beautiful spot isolated from the whirl
of cities, we open our eyes upon a new day.</p>

<p>There is no other joy so fine and none so
fleeting, perhaps, as this stirring of our individual
energies by the breath of that mighty
living force that recreates us each morning after
the apathy of night. At this instant of recognition
the day belongs to us and the air resounds
with a p√¶an of wonderful hopes and promises,
as if our single personality were the only concern
of nature. Soon the responsibilities of our
relations to others crowd out this sense of individual
life and the momentary Sabbath-peace
of the soul is broken up by the work-a-day hum
of jarring machinery. So, swift upon the exaltation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
aroused in Amanda by the influence of
an unshared sunrise, came the disappointing
sense of check and defeat to her own purposes
and plans, which had been wrought within the
last few hours. None of the reasons that led to
her decision to go away and begin a new life
remote from these surroundings had altered.
Fauquier County was still limited, narrow, and
hostile to Nellie's mental development; Benvenew
was still poverty-stricken, and no new
resources suggested themselves. And Vivian
was still the old Vivian, with all his vices upon
his head, and likely with the first hour of returning
health to repel and disgust her, just as
he had been doing all along. Every condition
she had dwelt upon as urgent cause of flight
was unchanged; and yet, with lightning swiftness
was accomplished that resolution, paralleled
in the experience of every one of us, by
which the one whose offenses had banished him
from her consideration, was made through sudden
appeal to pity, the object of first importance
to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>As Amanda turned from the window and
approached the bed where Vivian was now
opening eyes in which the light of reason was
absent, she turned her back upon all the rosy
hopes that had been dwelling in her imagination,
and took up the burden of a hard and
painful duty. For she was aware through the
prophetic insight that flashes through our acts
into the region of remote consequences, that
out of the immediate obligation of nursing her
husband back to health and strength, would
grow ties that would cramp and fetter all her
future. Her only defense against whatever his
will might impose upon her had been in her
feeling of antagonism. For, strong and self-poised
as she was, she had the woman's weak-point
of an intense susceptibility, and if she
had achieved the wish to be hard as nails, the
first touch from a beseeching hand would inevitably
break through the crust and betray
the lurking softness beneath.</p>

<p>It was with a quiver of fright that she realized,
as she raised Vivian's head upon her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
arm and felt him weakly recline against it, that
the barriers would soon be broken down between
them, and that there might enter into
her heart, destitute of respect and esteem that
pitiful substitute for true affection, a self-immolating
tenderness that leads judgment into
abysses where poisonous plants grow, exhaling
odors detrimental to sanity and health.
The flash of fear came and went, and no one,
save her mother, ever knew what Amanda's
concession meant to her, and what it involved.</p>

<p>Miss Evy had passed a sleepless night, and
at six o'clock she crept softly down to the door
of Vivian's bedroom and stood for a moment
before she knocked, listening for sounds that
she dreaded to hear, the sound of incoherent
murmuring, in femininely sweet tones.</p>

<p>"Come in," Amanda called, and she entered,
with a scared, anxious face and timid step.</p>

<p>"He's out of his mind, ain't he?" she
queried pitifully, and Amanda made an assenting
movement of the head.</p>

<p>Vivian's delirium was not violent at first,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
and he submitted to requirements with a gentleness
that was like his ordinary courtesy. But
he recognized no one for many days, showing
a preference, however, for Amanda and her
mother, over all the others who came in to
offer their services. His wife seemed to have
a peculiarly soothing effect upon him, and
with another variation from his attitude when
in health, he was impatient and fretful whenever
his mother appeared. Mrs. Thomas
took this hard, and in the parlor of the cottage,
where she sat most of the time seeing callers,
she bewailed the ingratitude of her son, and
whispered dark sayings against Amanda&mdash;"who wuz
tryin' now to throw dust in people's
eyes by makin' out she was dreadful fond o'
him, when if the truth wuz told&mdash;"</p>

<p>It seemed as if everybody within ten miles
around came with offers of help and utterances
of sympathy; the last delivered only to
Mrs. Thomas and Miss Evy, for few persons
saw Amanda. For ten days she watched by
Vivian's bedside with a devotion that completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
revolutionized all Miss Evy's ideas of
her, and astonished even her mother. And
when, from the very jaws of death, Vivian
came slowly back to life, he had become to
her like a dear child, whom it was her duty
to shield and minister to, and treat with a
tenderness unmingled with criticism. Whether
this mental attitude would continue was a
question. Mrs. Powell held counsel about it
with herself, and made it a subject of prayer:
"That Mandy would go on bein' forgivin' an'
lovin' an' that all'd go well betwixt her an' her
husband."</p>

<p>The exquisite season of Indian Summer,
the fifth season of the year in the mountain
region of Virginia, set in early, and one morning
when the air was so soft that it brought
to the surface all the gentle, kindly impulses
of hearts that stiffen and congeal under the
rough touch of frost, Amanda found herself
curiously moved as she stepped lightly about
Vivian's room, waiting for him to awake.</p>

<p>It often happens that a mental preparation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
unconsciously takes place in us for events
about to happen. A letter is on its way to
us, and we think of the writer, sometimes
expressing a solicitude the letter's contents
justify. A friend visits us and we meet him
with the remark that we were at that moment
longing for his presence. Some catastrophe
takes place that we were anticipating, and if
a pleasure is in the air its approach is heralded
by a peculiar elation and excitement that our
occupations cannot account for.</p>

<p>These are more tangible things, and easier
to understand than the subtle atmospheric
changes that pass along from heart to heart.
How can we explain the power affection has
to send its prophet before to prepare for its
coming? In some unexpected hour a certain
something tugs at our heart-strings and tunes
them up so that when the right hand is extended
a melody is evoked that we did not
think of or intend.</p>

<p>Amanda was a practical woman, not an emotional
one, but she was not therefore any the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
less alive to fine shades of feeling. She dusted
the bedroom with a piece of dampened cheese-cloth,
set carefully upon the stand the slender
necked Bohemian vase of flowers that were
Miss Evy's morning tribute, and laid out clean
towels beside the basin of fresh water upon
the chair by the bed, as methodically as usual.
Yet she was conscious of being in a state of
expectancy, as if she stood upon the eve of
something.</p>

<p>Vivian opened his eyes, larger and clearer
for his three weeks' illness, and looked in her
face with that solemn expression that accompanies
the return of consciousness after the
delirium of fever, and she trembled under the
rush of tenderness that his gaze awakened.</p>

<p>"Amanda!" he said feebly, "you in here!
Aren't you up early?"</p>

<p>"Not so very early, dear," she responded,
very gently. "It's you who have slept
late."</p>

<p>"Strange I don't feel more like getting up,"
he remarked. Then his gaze wandered over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the room, and came back in perplexity to her
face.</p>

<p>"Are you the genii?" he asked with a little
smile.</p>

<p>"Am I what?" She thought his wits were
wandering again.</p>

<p>"The genii. I must be Prince Camaralzaman.
I went to sleep in my own room last
night, and wake up in this, which I vow I
never saw before."</p>

<p>"You were indeed brought here, but not
from your own room. You have been here
three weeks, Vivian. You fell from your horse
into Mowbray Gulch and hurt your head, and
you have had brain fever."</p>

<p>She spoke slowly, and he followed her words
attentively, closing his eyes when she was
through, and lying perfectly quiet for a minute.
Then he said:</p>

<p>"Where is 'here?'"</p>

<p>"We are at Miss Evy Smith's. Her house
was the nearest place, you know, and you had
to be brought here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Evy Smith's!" he repeated, with a strange
little laugh. "That's singular." After an
interval, he added:</p>

<p>"Has she been nursing me?"</p>

<p>"She helped. She has been very, very kind.
A sister could not have done more."</p>

<p>"She was always sweet and obliging," he
observed. "But&mdash;Amanda, come sit down on
the bed, won't you? My voice seems mighty
weak, somehow."</p>

<p>"I mustn't let you talk," Amanda said. She
sat down on the edge of the bed, and as she
did so a flush settled upon her firm cheek and
stayed there. Not for three years had she
been so close to him. Perhaps he remembered,
too. What he said was:</p>

<p>"So it is you who have been taking care of
me? It was good of you, Amanda. I think
you must have grown rather fond of me while
I've been at your mercy here."</p>

<p>That unerring tact of his suggested exactly
the right thing to say. Not a word to jar the
delicate springs of feeling that had been set at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
work in her, and not a sign that he meant to
take advantage of her changed attitude.</p>

<p>He was too weak to think such matters out.
He merely obeyed the keen instinct that belongs
to natures like his, in emphasizing by
this casual allusion the leniency and indulgence
she must naturally feel toward him under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>Some people have the faculty of making us
feel grateful to them for permitting us to serve
them. Vivian had it. Amanda was so delighted
to see him recovering that she almost
felt like thanking him for it. Perhaps one
reason for this humility was that she had not
been free throughout his illness from the sting
of self-reproach. Outwardly she had ignored
Jane Thomas' bitter charge that her violent
conduct had indirectly caused Vivian's accident.
But in secret her conscience had taken
her to task again and again for her severity
toward him. If it had led to this she felt that
blame should rightly fall upon her.</p>

<p>No faculty of our nature brings to us keener
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
suffering than our sense of justice. Suppressed,
it cries out continually; exercised, it leads to
acts too positive to be endured in retrospect;
and this relenting of a strong nature, this going
back upon itself and its principles, is a common
occurrence in daily life.</p>

<p>Great risk attends such changes of mental
attitude, for character is built upon a belief
in the correctness of our own judgment. If
we ever come to a point where it appears probable
that everything we have held to and believed
in is a mistake, God help us!</p>

<p>Now, the strong point in Amanda's character
was her unflinching uprightness. She
had always dared tell the truth to herself,
using no palliations. And in this way she felt
certain of her ground. But now, for the first
time, the demon of self-distrust had entered
into her mind, and all her ideas and opinions
became affected by it.</p>

<p>If she had been to blame in her attitude
toward Vivian, how far was she to blame? In
what respect was she right? Poor Amanda
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
was now in a condition where Jane Thomas'
stinging remarks could cause her discomfort.
Strangely enough, her greatest consolation
was in the attachment Miss Evy had formed
for her.</p>

<p>"I don't know how I could ever have let
myself think of you as I used to think, Mrs.
Thomas," the gentle spinster had said once,
when they were upon confidential terms. "I'm
shore you're anything but unfeeling."</p>

<p>"Am I called that?" Amanda asked, not
without a pang. She was no longer above
caring what people said about her.</p>

<p>"Well, you know some people must have
something to say about everybody," Miss Evy
said, apologetically. "But since I know you,
why, I think you're real good; even good
enough for Mr. Thomas."</p>

<p>Amanda looked at her when she said that.
Something occurred to her that she had heard
a long time ago and forgotten.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said, quite gently, and
turned away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Evy's hospitality had not been worn
out by the severe test made of it. As a convalescent
Vivian had been endearing to the
last degree. It was congenial to him to be
waited upon, and the one severe and immitigable
suffering incidental to his illness (and
for which he secretly promised himself royal
amends) was almost made up for by the knowledge
that he had at last discovered Amanda's
weak point, and could hereafter, at least in a
measure, hold his own. Vivian did not put
it just this way to himself. He had as great a
genius for embroidering facts as Amanda had
for truth. What he said was that he was glad
to find that his wife was fond of him, after all.
And in a beautiful spirit he forgave her, and
took her to his heart.</p>

<p>This is what Fauquier County understood.
But it did not forgive Amanda.</p>

<p>A year later the county might have forgiven
her, if she had borne the misfortune that came
to her more meekly. But revolutions of character
are seldom permanent, and Amanda, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
compromising with her own judgment because
it found her consistently severe, entered into
that debatable territory where we are swayed
alternately by a desire to be gentle and an impulse
to be sharp.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to reproach ye, honey," her
mother said, one day when Amanda was spending
the day with her; "but somehow, yo' temper
ain't so even as it used to be. You wuz
always high&mdash;wantin' things yo' own way. It
ain't so much that now. But you's mo' easy
upset than you used to be."</p>

<p>Amanda turned her dark eyes upon her
mother. They were beautiful still. But that
crisis of a woman's life when her beauty begins
to fade had come to her early.</p>

<p>Upon her lap lay a three months' old baby.
It had a look of vigor, and a certain weird
beauty about its little face; but not for an
instant during her almost passionate care of
it had Amanda been able to forget something
that the flowing robes concealed from casual
glances. The child was hopelessly deformed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, dearie, I know," said Mrs. Powell,
her gaze following Amanda's as it was bent
upon the sleeping infant. "I know it's a trial.
And I'm ashamed I said anything. Nobody
need t' wonder at yo' bein' a mite out o' gear.
But trust the good Laud, Mandy, and He'll
bring everything out right, yit."</p>

<p>"Will He straighten baby's back, do you
think, mother? Or do you mean that He will
make things right by letting it die?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Powell's color arose, and she did not
venture to reply. Could any one but a mother
wish the child to live?</p>

<p>"He will not die," said Amanda, laying her
hand softly on the baby's thick golden hair.
There was intense feeling in the low tone, but
with her next words her voice took on a hard
quality that Mrs. Powell had learned to associate
with acute distress. "He will live," she
cried, but not loudly; "live to reproach his
father for a sin so dark that no one can name
it. Aye, we must hush it up. This is a 'visitation
of Providence,' in the opinion of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
good friends. Well, I don't call it that. The
truth is that it's a visitation of <i>liquor</i>, of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, Mandy!"</p>

<p>"Excuse my lack of delicacy," said Amanda,
with biting scorn. Not scorn of her mother,
but of the idea of the county as reflected in
her mother. She leaned back and drew a
fleecy white shawl carefully over the baby's
shoulders, then resumed sadly:</p>

<p>"I could stand it better, if I was free from
blame in my own eyes. I tell you, mother,
the only real hell is in knowing you're wrong,
and feeling, to the bottom of your heart that
you've brought suffering upon others by being
wrong."</p>

<p>"My dear child," quavered good Mrs. Powell,
"you's morbid. Yo' notion ain't the right
notion at all. How could you ahelped the
pore child's bein' so?"</p>

<p>"By standing to my colors. By obeying
my own conscience, no matter what the world
said."</p>

<p>"Mandy, yo' own sense must tell you't you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
couldn't ahelped it, noway. Even if you'd
kept on thinkin' 's you done. It wuz took
out'n yo' hands. You done yo' duty in stayin'
by Vivian when he wuz laid low, an' nobody
kin do mo'n their duty."</p>

<p>"It was my duty to nurse him. And after
that&mdash;after he was <i>well</i>, I should have&mdash;gone."</p>

<p>"Now, I reely thought you got fond o' Vivian,
an' I wuz thankin' the Laud for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, women are mostly fools," answered
Amanda, sweepingly. "But don't thank the
Lord for it, mother. The fruits of folly are
more bitter than the fruits of wilful sins, I
think."</p>

<p>"Mandy," said Mrs. Powell, rising in all the
might of her sensible, hearty, well-balanced
nature; "it won't do to be furever dwellin'
'pon what we've failed to do, an' what we ought
to adone. This world ain't heaven, and we's
right to rejoice with tremblin'; but there's a
sayin' I want to recommend to yo' pore, worn
heart: 'Again I say unto ye, rejoice.' That's
it, honey. Stop worryin' an' frettin' an' leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
things you can't alter if you wuz to kill yo'self
tryin'.</p>

<p>"An' now I'm a-goin' to hev Liza make a
co'n pudden' an' whip up cream fur the peaches,
an' you must please me by puttin' away everything
else an' givin' yo' mind to enjoyin' a
right good dinner. Thar's miseries in the
world, to be shore, but thar's comfort too, an'
to my thinkin' it's mighty good common sense
to take our fill o' creature comforts as we go
along, fur we's only got a certain length o'
time to stay 'pon this 'arth, an' we might as
well make the best on it."</p>

<p>"There are some things that have no best
side," said Amanda; but she said it rather
faintly. After all, there was logic in what her
mother expressed. She knew that nothing in
the world now could alter her opinion of Vivian;
nothing should ever again alter her
attitude toward him. But was there any
comfort or happiness to be got out of life
still?</p>

<p>Mrs. Powell had left the room, after pressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
a kiss upon her daughter's cheek, and another
upon the hair of the sleeping baby.</p>

<p>Through the window came the sound of
Nellie's voice, exclaiming to her little colored
playmates in vivacious accents: "There's papa
coming! Grandma said he was coming to
dinner;" and in another moment she skipped
into the room with her hand in that of the
fine-looking man who appeared before his wife
hat in hand, wearing a gentle, deprecating smile.</p>

<p>Amanda arose quickly, pressing her baby to
her breast, and stood looking at him with fire
in her eyes. Am I never to be safe from your
intrusion? her look said. But her lips were
mute, and with a lately learned self-control she
remained silent, while he filled in the embarrassing
moment with the graceful, fluent phrases
ever at his command.</p>

<p>"What a magnificent woman she is," thought
Vivian, as he threw himself into a chair, and
began to entertain little Nellie with some funny
anecdote, intensely conscious all the while of
the stately, stern presence that ignored him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly her gown brushed his knees as she
passed him on her way to the door, and he
glanced up rather uneasily.</p>

<p>"I'm only going to lay baby on the bed,"
she said in a low tone, not without the trace
of contempt she could never nowadays keep
out of her voice when speaking to him. But
in the other room, while she was bending over
her little one, there came to her one of those
humorous suggestions that visit us now and
then, to lighten our periods of depression.</p>

<p>"Man is, after all, only a kind of stomach,
and friendship but an eating together." The
sentence was from Carlyle, perhaps; anyway,
it was applicable to the situation. What was
the use of making such a serious affair out of
living?</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it is easy enough to be upon
friendly terms 'if friendship is but an eating
together,'" Amanda said to herself, grimly.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Mrs. Powell, sitting,
flushed and anxious at the head of her hospitable
table, rejoiced at the amenities that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
passed between her two guests, and whispered
to her own heart that everything was coming
out right, in the end. And to this determined
optimism Amanda, who interpreted her mother's
beaming looks perfectly, made no sign of
dissent. But Vivian, even with his facile acceptance
of all things in his favor, could not
help but realize to-day, very strongly, that
Amanda would never be to him, so long as she
lived, anything but an icicle. With her temper,
it might have been worse than that.</p>

<p class="center p2">I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sneaking Creek Church</span> had an unusually
full attendance on the Sunday morning
that saw Miles Armstrong's first wrestle with
his Satanic majesty, in the interests of that
congregation.</p>

<p>He was a well-grown boy of twenty, or so,
with the look of an eager colt scenting its first
honors in the wind, and determined to strain
every nerve to come in ahead at the finish. The
bright, brown eye, large and deep, turning here
and there with a half-timid, half-bold gaze,
the quivering nostril and tossing chestnut
mane over his long head gave him a likeness
to a high-bred horse, scarcely broken yet, and
destined to kick the traces somewhat before
settling down to a steady pace.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>
<p>The accommodations offered by the Second
Baptist Church to its preachers were not luxurious.
A straight-backed cane chair, and a
small square table holding a bible and a pitcher
of water were the creature comforts that stole
gently upon the senses of young Armstrong
after his ten-mile gallop over Fauquier County
roads that morning.</p>

<p>Nothing cared he for creature comforts.
Nothing either, for the fact that the congregation
facing him was composed of Fauquier
County's choicest and best in the line of hereditary
sinners; clothed in fine raiment and conscious
of waiting carriages and servants outside,
and of choice viands upon solid silver dishes at
the end of their journey homeward after they
had listened to the sermon. To him all these
personages, in rustling silks and fine broadcloth,
all these Haywoods, and Gordons, and Dudleys
were so many sick souls, needing the cordial
of the true gospel; so many criminally blind
beings with feet turned toward destruction,
careless of the light and life they might have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
by an effort that, to him, in his young zeal,
seemed so simple and slight; to them, perhaps,
involving sacrifices beyond his experience
and power to imagine.</p>

<p>Immediately in front of the platform stood
the organ, and seated bolt upright before this
was Miss Lavinia Powell, in a green silk waist
with skin-tight sleeves that prevented her raising
her arms to her head to twist up the wisp
of gray hair straggling from her door-knob
<i>coiffeur</i>, and which consequently held the uneasy
attention of a nervous woman in her rear
all church time. Had the hair belonged to
anybody else than Miss Lavinia Powell, the
neighbor would have ventured to reach over
and adjust it. But no one ever performed familiar
offices for Miss Powell. She was the quintessence
of spinsterhood, and her weapons of
defense were two gray eyes like a ferret's; of
offense&mdash;a tongue unparalleled for point.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the people were wondering
what Miss Lavinia thought of the new preacher.
He was not yet permanently engaged. Underneath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
all his concentrated purpose to utter
telling truths this morning, lurked the consciousness
that he was on probation. He felt, even
though it was impossible that he could have
heard the whisper that was running around the
church while he gave out the first hymn. It
began in the pew occupied by a couple of girls
who were visiting old Mrs. Powell, who sat with
her sweet, serene face turned toward the young
preacher with a look of beautifully blended
respect and benevolence. She heard none of
the gossip carried on by her nieces.</p>

<p>"Is he ordained?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. Not a minister at all yet."</p>

<p>"He's experienced sanctification, though."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he fell from grace, they say. Perhaps
that's why he looks so melancholy."</p>

<p>"Do you think he looks melancholy? To
me he just looks earnest. He's got splendid
eyes, but they're awfully deep. I'd be proud
of a man with eyes like that, wouldn't
you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>A smothered giggle, and a murmur to a
friend in the next pew.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in sanctification? The
preacher's experienced it."</p>

<p>Nellie Thomas heard the last remark, and
from that moment her reverential gaze was
fixed upon the thin, earnest face of the youthful
preacher. Her heart bowed before the
spiritual power abiding in him. She received
the sermon as a divine message, humbly responsive
to the persuasive words that sought
to arouse a conviction of sin in all hearers.</p>

<p>"We are all of us in the mire of sin," uttered
the clear young voice in solemn accents.
"Every one of us should take shame to himself
for his sins. You that wear elegant clothes
and live in great houses are no better than the
beggar&mdash;the tramp&mdash;that goes from one back
door to another&mdash;in the matter of sin. The
back door of the Father's house is the door
we'll have to go to when we want to enter into
heaven. If you are proud and lofty-minded,
and think yourself good enough to be admitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
at the front door it is all the more certain that
you'll be turned away and made to go around
to the back entrance, and made to wait there
knocking a long time before you are let in.
And good enough for you, too. Are any one
of us fit to enter into the presence of the Lord?
If any one of us thinks so he ought to take
shame to himself for the notion. If I had such
a false notion in my own head I'd take shame
to myself for it."</p>

<p>The sermon went on, the emphatic voice falling
at the end of every sentence as if the speaker
had the intent to drive home his argument by
verbal knocks. The respectable audience was
browbeaten and held up to ridicule for its pretensions
to virtue; it was proved conclusively
that not a hope of salvation could be reasonably
cherished by a single person present.
Proved to the general mind. A few persons
remained in doubt, and one&mdash;a man seated with
folded arms in the middle of the church&mdash;continued
utterly skeptical. He had attended
closely to the sermon, his broad, ruddy face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
expressing throughout a kindly sympathy with
the preacher, curiously mingled with concern.
Now and then he had allowed a great sigh to
escape him, and once he moved restlessly as if
impelled to utter a protest. But he mastered
the impulse and kept quiet until the final word
was said, and the preacher in an agitated voice
gave out the last hymn. All the hymns had
been mournful. This was brighter. Perhaps
the congregation embraced the opportunity for
a change of mood, for the hymn swelled out
with unwonted vigor, nearly every one falling
in with the second stanza.</p>

<p>A powerful bass voice projected itself from
the lungs of the good-humored-looking skeptic.
Throwing back his head he roared forth a
melodious bellow that drowned all other individual
accents&mdash;save one. Nellie Thomas'
bird-like tones thrilled their roundelay of worship
with the silvery clearness of the skylark.
With the freshness and innocence of some lark
reared on the top bough of a giant tree, high
above the strife and guilt of the world. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
throb of feeling in the tones came from the
same source that a child's emotions of worship
come from; an awed sense of personal inferiority
to some element of perfection dwelling
somewhere in the universe, and approached
on timid wings of faith. Unconscious of self,
her sweet voice brightened and strengthened
until the mass of sound outside seemed but a
great accompaniment, the mighty single bass
bearing her up as if it held her aloft in its arms.</p>

<p>This was what Peter Weaver came to church
for. Singing devotional songs with little Nellie
was the crown and cap-sheaf of the week's
silent, unrecognized worship that was carried
on with the generous abandonment of a mind
seeking no reward beyond the privilege of
devoting itself to its cherished object. The
simple, brave soul lodged in Peter's huge frame
joyed in surrounding the young girl with a protecting
fondness that was like an invisible shield
interposed between her and harm. He had
never cared for any other girl, and he had cared
for her ever since she&mdash;a radiant maid of six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
years in a pink lawn frock and white sun-bonnet&mdash;entered
the old school-house door one morning
twelve years before, and transformed the
loutish boy puzzling over sums, into a poet and
a knight-errant, bound forever to her service.
During all these years that he had carried her
school-books, gathered wild-flowers for her from
dangerous mountain crevasses, and catered to
her gentle whims in every way a man might,
who bore her continually in his heart and
studied how best to give her pleasure, Peter
had never broken in upon this friendship by a
word of the sentiment of which his poet-soul
was full. Nellie, called by her admirers the
beauty of Virginia, was to him the living embodiment
of the sweetbriar rose, too delicate,
too sensitive to be plucked and worn, even by
one worthy of that distinction. Himself, he
thought scarce worthy to tie her little shoe.</p>

<p>And yet, except in contrast with this Dresden
china creature, with her skin of milk and roses,
her golden brown eyes so soft and shy, and her
cloud of sunny curls, fine as floss, the modest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
farmer-poet, tied by circumstances to homely
tasks, was not a man to be despised. His
height, which was six feet two inches, was sustained
by good breadth of shoulder and shapeliness
of limb. His round head, covered with
short, crisp, black locks, was well set, and his
pleasant eyes, of an opaque blue like the hue
of old Dutch pottery, looked out at you with a
frank and honest expression. There was too
much color in his cheek, but it was a clear,
bright red, showing healthy blood beneath, as
free from venom as his nature. He was now
thirty-two years old, and his philosophical
temperament, not wanting in capacity for deep
thinking, made his years set lightly upon him.
He was still rather a great boy than a mature
man, in the opinion of most people, and perhaps
of all the men and women in Fauquier
County who knew and liked Peter Weaver, but
one person recognized and appreciated the
sound, sane mind, the capacity for heroic action
that lay beneath his eccentricities and
commonplace, almost awkward bearing. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
friend was Amanda Thomas, the widowed mistress
of Benvenew, called Mistress Amanda, to
distinguish her from old widow Thomas, her
mother-in-law.</p>

<p>Mistress Amanda's strong character rather
than any external advantages had made her an
important personage in the county. Her kinsfolk,
the Powells, were impoverished, and her
husband, the bright particular star of the sporting
set, had left her an affectionate legacy of
debts, together with an invalid child whose
malady set him apart from the working world
and enshrined him in his mother's heart as
something to be tenderly cherished at any cost
to herself or others. This boy was never seen
out of his home, and people whispered dark
stories of his strange and dangerous moods,
in which no one could do anything with him
save Peter Weaver.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that Peter Weaver, whose
oddities were not upheld by an ancient Virginia
family name, was, nevertheless, welcomed as a
favorite guest at Benvenew, where many a proud
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
youngster hung about, thinking himself rewarded
for hours of patient homage to the
stately mistress, by a glimpse of shy Nellie. He
and Mistress Amanda had come to that complete
understanding when a glance interchanged
means a whole volume of explanation. It was
natural for this glance to be interchanged when
they differed from prevailing opinions.</p>

<p>Therefore, it was this great lady's gaze that
caught and held the doubtful look that Peter
threw toward the preacher while the final argument
was being made as to the absolute
necessity for all of them to be bowed down in
humiliation over their sins. Some rapid question
and answer seemed to pass between the
two that left Peter satisfied. He threw himself
into the singing with more than common
zeal, and when the moment came for a general
relaxing from the stiffness of sermon-tide he
walked out of his pew and up toward the front
with a fixed purpose plainly written upon his
face.</p>

<p>The youthful preacher had stepped down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
from the platform, and with the step he seemed
to become another man. All the severity had
vanished both from countenance and manner.
Bright, kind, with a suppressed liveliness that
became in the passage from heart to tongue
cheerful and witty response to the pleasant
clamor around him, he was like a man who had
thrown off the weight of a heavy responsibility,
and got back home again. But outward transformations
are not to be taken as signs of deep
internal changes. The man who laughs at your
dinner table is the same man who refused to
abate his stern judgment against your brother
yesterday. He is not to be played with because
he chooses to be humorous.</p>

<p>Peter Weaver was now standing beside the
preacher. Mistress Amanda introduced them,
and then turned so that her voluminous
draperies made a barrier between the two men
and the groups behind.</p>

<p>Young Armstrong's slim hand yielded a ready
clasp to the mighty grip of the farmer-poet,
who was anxious to express in this greeting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
more than usual good-will and interest. To
balance what he had made up his mind it was
his duty to say.</p>

<p>"I'm shore them that have a better right than
me to express an opinion have thanked you
for your sermon," said Peter. Always slow, his
speech was now even ponderous, through anxiety
to find appropriate words. Some of his
thickness of his Dutch grandfather's tongue
had descended to him, along with a short-sighted
and earnest devotion to duty.</p>

<p>Armstrong answered by some light word,
divining, by that super-sensitiveness of the
young enthusiast, that a criticism was in the air.
He looked up at the honest red face half a head
higher than his own pale one, with a little curiosity.
Peter's kindliness was so vast that he felt
like a school-boy being forgiven by the professor
of moral philosophy. A strange feeling for an
expounder of the sacred word to experience
in the presence of an apparently commonplace
man.</p>

<p>"It was a good sermon," Peter went on;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
"that is, good because there was an honest
purpose in it. But I don't agree with you, sir."</p>

<p>"Don't you?" retorted the preacher, smiling.
He was not displeased that his first sermon
contained stuff for argument.</p>

<p>"You see, your point of view is the point of
view of a well-meaning but inexperienced young
man. The world isn't near as bad as you made
it out. There's a lot of good in human nature,
and you'll find it out after awhile. I'm not
afraid but what you'll find it out. But I'd be
sorry to have you go on saying all these hard
things that don't do any good. The only way to
make people better is to take hold of some good
thing about 'em and build on it. The world
wants to be encouraged, not discouraged, sir!"</p>

<p>Armstrong felt now like a boy in the infant
class being lectured by the Sabbath-school
superintendent. His white teeth closed down
over his lower lip. It galled him to have to
look up to meet the eyes of this singular individual.
But he rallied himself gallantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think very well of human nature,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
he said, in his strong, clear tones. "But you
know we must not look at things from <i>that</i>
standpoint. Anything short of perfection is
rottenness in the eyes of God. And who
among us is anywhere near perfect?"</p>

<p>"Still, the world wants encouraging," repeated
Peter.</p>

<p>It was the idea he had intended to emphasize.
He wished that this fine young man and himself
were seated on the porch of his little green cottage,
with a pipe apiece, and the afternoon before
them to talk the matter out. But nearly
everybody had left the church. Only half a
dozen or so lingered to exchange a word with
the preacher. Courteous Peter felt that he had
been to the fore long enough. He extended
his hand again, and gave Armstrong's a cordial
grip.</p>

<p>"Your face contradicts your preaching," he
concluded, backing away reluctantly. "You'll
not be so severe when you let yourself be as
much in sympathy with people as nature meant
you to be!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>He bowed in his ungainly fashion, and
walked on out. Armstrong's attention was
immediately engaged by Mistress Amanda,
who invited him to go home with her to dinner.
She had listened with keen interest to the
little exchange of views between the preacher
and Peter. Her sympathy was with Peter.
She had less toleration than he for the intolerance
of others. There is no bigotry like the
bigotry of an egoistic mind that thinks itself
liberal; and Mistress Amanda felt an impatient
contempt for the hard and fast Calvinism of
the preacher. But personal preferences were
not allowed to stand in the way of hospitality.
The preacher was pressed to come to Benvenew
and stay over until Monday, when he could
ride back to Roselawn, the Armstrong dwelling,
in the cool air of the morning.</p>

<p>Other persons had felt a sense of their hospitable
duties. In fact, Armstrong was half
engaged to go to the Gordons. He was turning
his gracefully uttered thanks into a refusal,
when Mistress Amanda moved toward the pew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
on her left to pick up her fan, and in so doing
gave him a glimpse of Nellie, who had kept
modestly behind her mother all this time.
Mistress Amanda was tall; Nellie was short
and slim; a sylph, a dainty fairy figure, over
whose face played the luminous light of the
moon as it is reflected in water. Her great
soft eyes dwelt upon him with pathetic sympathy.
The brightness of partizanship was
there, too. A dove whose heart had been
moved to side with an eagle engaged in combat
with its fellow would probably have looked so.
Nellie felt in her gentle bosom the stirring of
vindictiveness against Peter's rough hands that
had essayed to tear away the veil of sanctity
which hung over the Lord's chosen vessel.
Her ears still held the echo of those strong,
stern words with which the preacher had rebuked
sin. She mentally bowed before them.
She, too, was a sinner. Oh, that he might lead
her into the light!</p>

<p>Armstrong's eyes had found her while these
thoughts were writing themselves upon her innocent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
face. In a second he caught a breath
of that incense which filled the heart of the
sweetbriar rose. Youth, enthusiasm, worshipful
instinct met and united in the one swift
glance. The words of excuse died away in
Armstrong's throat.</p>

<p>"Let me present you to my daughter,
Nellie," said Mistress Amanda carelessly; hearing
only a murmured acceptance of her invitation.
The young girl bent her head,
the rose tint deepening in her cheeks. The
preacher bowed as to a queen. His manner
seemed a trifle exaggerated to Mistress
Amanda, but her critical reading of his character
was that he would probably over-do everything.</p>

<p>She moved toward the church door with
him, her negligent glance taking in an impression
of a rather good-looking, gentlemanly
bigot. Such people were bores that good
breeding obliged one to suffer patiently.</p>

<p>The church was perfectly quiet by the time
they had reached the door, for they were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
last. The crowd outside compelled them to
stop for an instant in the vestibule.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came to the ears of all three
the sound of a long, mournful howl, deeper
than that any dog could make; heavy yet
tremulous, as of something in great distress.</p>

<p>Peter had been stayed at the door&mdash;probably
he had loitered to see Nellie&mdash;and he, too,
heard the sound. His round eyes widened and
his mouth opened in astonishment. Without
dying away completely the painful bellow was
renewed.</p>

<p>It seemed to come from the interior of the
church.</p>


<p class="center p2">II.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> remarkable epithet rolled from the
throat of Peter as he turned his head from side
to side in a perplexed grasping after the location
of this disturbance.</p>

<p>"It seems to come from the basement,"
observed Mistress Amanda. Peter strode to
the basement door and took hold of the knob.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
It was locked; an occurrence so unusual as to
arouse renewed surprise.</p>

<p>There was now a renewal of the sounds;
a succession of low, long-drawn-out bellows, becoming
more and more faint, and dying away
completely while the four listeners stood looking
at each other.</p>

<p>"May not some stray cow have got into the
basement or cellar?" Armstrong suggested.
It seemed to him that this big farmer showed
more annoyance than the occasion demanded.
Doubtless the explanation would prove to be
very simple. But he had not Peter's premises
to argue from. Mistress Amanda and he both
knew that if any animal was imprisoned beneath
the church it must have been driven there,
and shut in. Why should such a thing be
done? There was but one explanation. Over
a week ago a fine cow belonging to Peter had
bodily disappeared, without leaving a trace to
identify the thief. He had had a strong suspicion
that the guilt lay at the door of his
neighbor, Theodore Funkhausen, one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
richest men in the county, but commonly
called "Skunk." Many a quarrel had taken
place between "Skunk" and Peter Weaver, in
which the generous nature had been the victim.
The last one dated a fortnight back, and
was about Peter's cattle. Soon afterward the
cow had disappeared. Funkhausen's sour visage
had worn a particularly malicious look
lately, when he and Peter met, a look that one
who knew him might interpret as pleasure in
an accomplished act of vengeance.</p>

<p>"I'm going to get at the meaning of them
noises," said Peter, with mighty emphasis, and
he laid violent hands upon the door lock, which
was weak and yielded without much resistance.
"If it's as I think," he added calmly, "Thed
Funkhausen's going to have one thrashing!"
He descended the dark stairway, and they heard
the crackle of matches as he went. Peter's pipe
was not in his pocket when he attended church
but his match-box was.</p>

<p>"What does he mean?" asked Armstrong
of Mistress Amanda. The boyish liking for an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
adventure and the instinct of the southerner
for a fight struggled in his breast with the
severity of the preacher. He had a vague idea
that Peter Weaver was one of the unregenerate
persons toward whom one's sympathies must
not be allowed to flow incautiously. On the
other hand, Funkhausen's reputation had
reached Roselawn. To the fact that he was a
<i>carpet-bagger</i>, the true-blooded Virginian laid
some contemptible acts which otherwise would
have been unaccountable. But there were persons
who found the rich man good enough in
his way, and he had a certain following, was a
school trustee, member of the county jockey-club,
and sure of a seat among the judges at
the annual fair. Consequently, when he took
it into his head to quarrel the possibility of
his antagonist being in the wrong naturally
presented itself to fair minds.</p>

<p>Armstrong had never heard of Peter Weaver,
although the farmer-poet was well known
throughout the county, and now that he had
made his acquaintance he was not greatly disposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
to admire him. There was enough resentment
in his mind for the elder man's plain
speaking to make neutrality in a quarrel between
him and Funkhausen appear a Christian
duty. But he could not find fault with any circumstances
that led to his standing in the little
vestibule close to this wonderfully fair young
girl, whose spiritual face wore the far-away look
of one whose thoughts are set on things above
this earth. Yet Nellie had her practical side.
In some things she was more practical than her
mother.</p>

<p>Mistress Amanda's commanding bearing,
however, was a complete contrast to the young
girl's modest, timid mien. Her fine, black eyes
rested coldly upon the young man who had put
his question to her in a judicial tone. She
murmured a few words that were no reply, and
busied herself in drawing up the folds of her
black satin skirt to sweep out to her carriage.
Peter was heard coming up the steps. He
emerged with an apoplectic face, breathing
hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Was</i> it?" asked Mistress Amanda.</p>

<p>He nodded. "Shorely, starved to death&mdash;the
darned skunk!"</p>

<p>His friend gave him a look expressive of the
wisdom of keeping cool and waiting for the
right occasion. It was something like throwing
water on a red-hot stove. But Peter had unlimited
confidence in the good sense of Mistress
Amanda. And he bore in mind that it is a
man's duty not to show fight in the presence
of ladies. So, sighing inwardly, he helped them
up the step of the great family coach, where
old Mrs. Powell and her niece were seated,
waiting; and, mounting his horse, rode off at a
pace that harmonized with his feelings.</p>

<p>Peter's bulk was unhandsome on horseback.
As young Armstrong lightly vaulted into his
saddle and reined his horse beside the window,
where Nellie's sweet face peeped out from beneath
the shadow of a flower-laden leghorn hat,
she silently noted the contrast between the
riders.</p>

<p>"What kep' you so, Mandy?" asked old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Mrs. Powell, with as near the suspicion of a
complaint in her voice as ever got into it.</p>

<p>"Why, something very singular, mother.
Would you credit it, that Funkhausen put
Peter Weaver's cow under the church and
starved it to death! We heard its moans&mdash;probably
its last ones, and Peter went down
and found it. He says he'll thrash Funkhausen,
and I think everybody in the county'll
stand by him if he does."</p>

<p>"How perfectly dreadful!" chimed in the
girls, in thrilled accents.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, Mandy, that wuz mean indeed of
Funkhausen," said the grieved old lady. "And
he a member o' the chu'ch, and holdin' to particular
redemption, which he oughtn't to dare
to do less he's shore he's one o' the elect hisself."</p>

<p>"He'll need all his particular redemption&mdash;when
Peter gets hold of him," commented
Mistress Amanda, who was no Antinomian.
She took some pleasure in making remarks like
these, less to shock her mother, to whom she
was more tenderly deferential than to anybody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
else in the world, than to enlarge the
outlook of Nellie, whose innate bent toward
Calvinism irritated her. She disbelieved in the
possibility of a woman saint under sixty. Of
men, she had been heard to remark that they
"only got to heaven through the grace of God
and the goodness of women." But while she
hated pretensions to special piety she readily
pardoned sinners who were confessedly incorrigible.
She would overlook all offenses save
self-complacency or the possession of a bloodless
nature incapable alike of sterling virtues or
robust wickedness. There are persons to whom
the touch of velvet is odious. Mistress Amanda
detested velvety natures. Some Viking-like
quality in the woman, something fierce and
grand as the breaking of a storm at sea, threw
out a challenge for rough honesty; for the
strong hand of untamed manhood to touch and
calm her mood. In Peter Weaver she realized
her ideal of robust, simple manliness. Twenty
years before her maiden fancies would have
passed him by with disdain. But there comes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
a period of life when a second set of desires
replace the dreams of youth, unlike them in
every respect, especially where "the curse of a
granted prayer" has robbed the dreamer of illusions.
In so many words, Mistress Amanda
had never said to herself since she had been
left a widow five years ago,&mdash;I like best the
man who least resembles my husband:&mdash;but
her regard involuntarily fell upon everything
in the shape of both men and women, who
were innocent of the suavity, the grace, and
the polished egotism of the late Col. Thomas.</p>

<p>To revise one's personal ideals is sometimes
commendable; but a good mother usually reads
her new philosophy into the life of her daughter.
In Mistress Amanda's hands Nellie had
been as ductile as gold foil, showing a fragility,
however, that exacted delicate treatment. Here
was a sweet, affectionate, domestic disposition,
without any of the deep and subtle qualities
that had rendered her own life stormy; a
nature formed to lean on strength and create a
happy home for a good man. And Mistress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Amanda had given to Peter's shy wooing an
unspoken but emphatic approval. But the
sleeping beauty's repose was not yet broken.
Nellie's maidenly meditations had still leave to
wander where they listed. But one little cloud
hung over the rosy sky of Mistress Amanda's
hopes: Nellie, always given to shy musings and
conscientious scruples&mdash;had lately shown a
strong bias toward her grandmother's religious
convictions. Indeed, it often seemed to Mistress
Amanda, whose ambition and passionately
maternal nature would have fitted her to
be the mother of heroes, that her daughter belonged
more to old lady Powell than to herself.</p>

<p>A dear, sweet old lady, with a heart full to
overflowing with the milk of human kindness,
and yet she had unconsciously become a moral
stumbling-block to the one person whose happiness
she was in every way most desirous of
serving.</p>

<p>Poor Mistress Amanda had never found any
aid from nature in carrying out her plans, but
she was not the woman to relinquish one on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
that account. She relied upon the aid of
chance to bring that proof to Nellie of Peter
Weaver's worth, which would make her tolerant
of his rationalism.</p>

<p>A poet and a skeptic! Only in the degree
which made it necessary for the solitary man,
thinking out all things for himself, and philosophizing
upon life with the sky and woods for
counselors, to reach conclusions that he could
connect with the way things had of turning
out. Calvinism did not seem to him to connect
with the law of duty to your neighbor as
it presented itself to his conception; and his
theology took this simple formula: bear and
forbear as long as you can, and then strike good
blows; leaving alone the consequences.</p>

<p>And Nellie was a very mimosa for sensitiveness,
as to the sin of differing from one's spiritual
advisers. Mistress Amanda looked at her
daughter, a translucent opal set between those
gilded spurs, her cousins, and reflected upon
the pains nature takes to bring about disharmony
in families.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>As the carriage approached the gates of
Benvenew two little darkies raced out and held
them wide open, with a special grin and duck
for the gentleman on horseback, whose dimes
rolled in the dust, sped by the careless, free
hand of one who remembered himself an Armstrong,
forgetting the preacher. But the set
of the preacher was strong in the man. It was
apparent at dinner; that excellent dinner where
the golden brown turkey at one end of the
table was rivaled by the noble ham at the
other end, and where corn-pudding, sweet potatoes,
and tomatoes in firm, rose-red slices,
were reflected in crystal-clear goblets of cut-glass,
standing sentinel-like upon napkins
of double-wove Barnsley damask, white
as sunbleach and rain water could make
them.</p>

<p>Armstrong sat at Mistress Amanda's right
hand, with Nellie opposite, her hands constantly
busy playing over the jellies and <i>entr√©es</i>
set in front of her to serve. Drooping curls
half-hid her face, but his eyes dived keenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
into the cool, sweet depths of hers when by
chance she looked up. And she had the pleasantly
fluttered sense of being watched by one
curiously sympathetic with her.</p>

<p>"You are like your father," Mistress Amanda
was saying. "Like what he was at your
age. I met him once at a tournament held
over at Purcellville. A pleasant part of the
country, and a pleasant time we young people
had that day."</p>

<p>"And you was crowned queen o' love and
beauty, Mandy," cooed old Mrs. Powell. "I
see by your face though, sir, that you don't
hold to these fashions?"</p>

<p>"Should I hold to any customs that encourage
vanity and display, and un-Christian rivalry?"
returned the young preacher. "I understand
there is to be a tournament held here
in the fall, at Rocky Point. I shall feel it my
duty to warn all our young people who have
felt the strivings of the Spirit, not to yield to
the temptation."</p>

<p>"I am so glad!" the fleeting cry came from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Nellie involuntarily, and when Armstrong covered
her flushing face with a soft look of encouragement,
she continued sedately:</p>

<p>"I think such things take us too far away
from our serious duties in life."</p>

<p>"Nellie is passing through one of those
phases peculiar to youth," observed her mother.
"Attacks of acute religious fanaticism are a
sort of moral measles."</p>

<p>"Madam!" uttered Armstrong in a shocked
tone, but meeting that calm glance of the
elder woman, secure in the dignity of her deeper
life experiences, he softened his tone apologetically:</p>

<p>"I beg you will not construe my criticism
of the custom of tournaments into a criticism
of yourself. Doubtless there was formerly a
greater license in the Church concerning these
things. Even dancing picnics were tolerated&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the bold lady. "We
must have amusements, we southerners. We
are not Puritans."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall the Puritans hold their faith more
purely than ourselves? I see no reason why
the very enthusiasm and eagerness for amusements
natural to southerners should not be
turned into the channels of a deeper Christianity."</p>

<p>Quite an argument ensued, in which it was
notable that the forces were drawn up three to
a side; old Mrs. Powell, Nellie, and Armstrong
against Mistress Amanda and her two cousins,
city-bred girls, desirous of shining in conversation.</p>

<p>Mistress Amanda carried on the battle with
one hand behind her, so to speak. She disdained
to put forth her full intellectual strength
to rout a stripling. And half her mind was
wandering abroad in a flight after her hero,
pursuing his angry way homeward. Could her
imagination have given her a true picture of
Peter's adventures on the road, she might have
dropped the feint of interest in the dinner-table
topics to enjoy the thrill of real feeling, in a
more singular and vigorous turn of events than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
was promised by the mild social elements gathered
at Benvenew.</p>

<p>Peter had met his enemy on the lane turning
off toward The Oaks, Funkhausen's place.
He was driving along at a leisurely pace in his
carryall alone, enjoying his meditations, when a
fierce-browed horseman reined up beside him
and caught the relaxed reins from his hands.</p>

<p>"Git out o' that, Thed Funkhausen," commanded
Peter. "I've a word or two with you."</p>

<p>"Hadn't it better keep till another time?"
suggested Funkhausen in a tone meant to be
pacific.</p>

<p>"No, it won't keep!" thundered Peter, who
had no mind to let his present wrath cool into
his habitual, easy-going tolerance. And there
was a force of circumstances in his having possession
of the road and the reins, which compelled
Funkhausen to step out; Peter dismounting
at the same minute.</p>

<p>"What'd you shut my cow up for and
starve her to death?"</p>

<p>A smile of sly enjoyment overspread Funkhausen's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
face. He did not deny the charge,
seeming rather to take pride in an achievement
so original. Funkhausen feared his huge antagonist,
but beside being a burly man himself,
he believed that he was near enough to
home for his negroes to be within call; and
there was a small army of farm-hands in his
service.</p>

<p>So, charges were met by defiance, and Peter's
temper ran no risk of dying away without finding
vent. It came to blows before many expletives
had made the air hot, and, as might
have been expected, Funkhausen was tendered
to the care of mother earth, with dust for his
pillow. But although with that issue Peter
began to find forgiveness sprouting in his soul,
new complications arose. The farm-hands were
within call, taking their ease before their cabin
doors, and enjoying the smell of their dinners
cooking. At Funkhausen's lusty cries they
came pouring down the lane, realizing the duty
of obedience to the man who supplied their
bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Surround him! Surround the low-lived
coon!" yelled Funkhausen, sputtering and
winking, wiping the blood from his nose with
his best Sunday pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>And the negroes closed around the tall figure,
standing firm and solid, with nothing but
his fists to oppose to the force of numbers.</p>

<p>The negroes numbered fifteen men.</p>


<p class="center p2">III.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sunshine of a perfect October day lay
full upon Peter Weaver's great front porch, as
he sat in his red armchair, smoking his after-dinner
pipe, two months after his encounter
with Funkhausen. Behind the porch lay the
house; a minor affair, yet comfortable in its
way. So long as weather permitted Peter
lived upon his porches, the back one, fronting
east, in the mornings, and the front one with
the western exposure in the afternoon. From
it he could see the goose-pond where his flock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
disported, and the road, not very lively, but
with passing features of interest to a society
loving mind.</p>

<p>His bachelor housekeeping was simple, his
farm small, and the good grandparents had
brought with them from Holland a store of
Dutch guelders which had been converted into
mining stock in due course, and, passing down
to Peter, made his living a comfortable one.
Had he chosen to loaf all day long upon his
porches his income would have enabled him
to do so. And old Aunt Vina and her two
sons would not have lost their wages, nor the
church its annual liberal check. But Peter had
an industrious streak in him, and worked with
all his might when he did work. Afterwards
he indulged himself in spells of meditation and
verse-writing.</p>

<p>How he had first gained courage to put himself
before the public as a poet is a mystery.
Possibly he had hopes of making his name
illustrious in little Nellie's eyes. It is certain
that a copy of the <i>Purcellville Banner</i> with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
heavy lines in red ink drawn around a sonnet
addressed to "A Sweetbriar Rose," and signed
"Heinrichs," had reached Benvenew the day
after being issued. Since then the poet had
branched out in other directions and the <i>Banner's</i>
columns were enriched with an amount of
original matter that led the editor seriously to
contemplate the possibility of abandoning a
"patent outside," and depending upon home
talent to fill his space. Eventually, the disguise
maintained by "Heinrichs" was penetrated by
his neighbors and Peter was made the recipient
of attentions varying from invitations
to dine and display his talent for versification
at the Gordons, all the way down to
lampoons in chalk upon his barn-door, and
hootings from the six red-haired little Clapsaddles.</p>

<p>Pendleton Haywood, riding by one morning,
espied the sturdy poet with his sleeves rolled
up, deep in molasses-making; and thought it
opportune to call out:</p>

<p>"Peter, make me a rhyme!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>With extraordinary quickness this rejoinder
was thundered back:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">"I'm busy just now,</div>
    <div class="verse">Stirring my molasses,</div>
    <div class="verse">I've no time</div>
    <div class="verse">To make a rhyme</div>
    <div class="verse">For every fool that passes."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And Pendleton went on his way a sadder
man; for the six red-haired little Clapsaddles
were as usual hanging about the goose-pond, and
had made themselves masters of this colloquy;
which, consequently, spread with the rapidity
of a Virginia creeper, from Rocky Point to
Purcellville.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Peter's gift was a
great comfort to him, and, modest as he was,
he accepted the inevitable fame growing out of
his contributions to the <i>Banner</i> with a certain
degree of complacency. The power of looking
at the events of life with a view to turning
them into poetry invests even common subjects
with interest, and when any really exciting
thing happens the gifted mind is conscious of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
a wonderfully uplifting feeling, such as the
admiral of a fleet may experience when an
enemy's ironclad opens fire. Opportunity is
the spur that starts genius into a canter.</p>

<p>Peter sat smoking, and thinking how to turn
the fight between himself and Funkhausen into
a poem which should arouse the enthusiastic
admiration of all readers of the <i>Banner</i>; including
Mistress Amanda and perhaps Nellie.</p>

<p>When Funkhausen had set his hirelings upon
the stalwart Peter he had not taken into account
two things: one was that there was not
a darkey in the county without a feeling of
personal liking for the kind-hearted poet, and
the other, that negroes are cowardly except
under the influence of excitement. The foremost
man in the group happened to be one to
whose family Peter had rendered many kindnesses.
When the blue eyes of his master's
victim looked steadily into his own, Jake felt a
curious tremor of mingled superstition and perplexity,
which caused him to fall back on his
comrades instead of advancing to the attack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Funkhausen was doing his best to urge on.
Peter's raised fist conveyed reminder as well as
menace. That hand had been ready to extend
help to those in need, but it was equally ready
to strike down an offender. And the negroes
did not like the looks of the strong, resolute
white man standing upon the defensive, alone,
but with right upon his side. They began to
mutter and to fall back, until the whole mass
had melted away; in some way bearing Funkhausen
along with them. Whereupon Peter
mounted his horse and quietly rode home.</p>

<p>But the county rang with the affair. As
much to vindicate himself as for vengeance,
Funkhausen had Peter up before the church
for discipline. But to his disgust, and to the
delight of everybody else, Deacon Greene declared
that Peter had done nothing to be disciplined
for; but that "if he hadn't fought
Funkhausen the church would have turned
him out!"</p>

<p>Mistress Amanda gave a dinner party and
made Peter the guest of the occasion. It happened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
upon Michaelmas and old Aunt Viny
insisted, for luck's sake, upon dressing a pair of
her master's geese, and sending them to Benvenew.
So that Peter had the pleasure of seeing
pretty Nellie blush under the sly allusion made
by one of the guests to the old proverb about
"the maid that eats of the bachelor's goose."
But on the other hand, common sense told him
that blushing was with Nellie no sign of especial
embarrassment. Indeed, it was probable that
the proverb was unknown to her. She was
much occupied, all dinner-time, with the account
young Armstrong&mdash;now ordained and installed
as the regular preacher for Sneaking Creek
church&mdash;was giving her of a bush-meeting in
the woods back of Purcellville. He was anxious
for her mother to take her to the meetings,
but Mistress Amanda did not like bush-meetings;
and she was not inclined to encourage
any species of religious excitement in Nellie.
Peter would gladly have offered to drive her
but he could not venture to do so in the face of
her mother's disapproval. It seemed a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
hard to him that he should not be able to avail
himself of this little opportunity to please the
young girl. And if jealousy had been possible
to him he must have felt a twinge of it in seeing
how absorbed Nellie was in the talk Armstrong
was pouring into her ears. But the
time had not yet come for him to recognize the
significance of what was going on under his
eye. The happenings of our daily life are like
the characters at a masked ball. Capering before
us, they seem entirely unrelated to ourselves
in any particular, and it is only when they unmask
that we know them for what they are.</p>

<p>Peter, the dreamer, wove some new fancies
about his dainty love as he sat with a writing
pad upon his knee, and his short pipe between
his lips. The world was very beautiful to him.
And to-morrow would be Sunday; the happiest
day of all the good week; for he would see
Nellie at church.</p>

<p>The collie dog at his feet jumped up and ran
down the walk. At the gate stood a shabby
phaeton made distinguished by carrying Mistress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Amanda. As he hastened out she called
in a loud, clear tone:</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Weaver, have you any
turkey eggs to spare?"</p>

<p>Her hand, in its old gray gauntlet, was extended,
and as he took it for a second in his own
she added, lower,</p>

<p>"So much as a concession to our neighbor's
greed, yonder!"</p>

<p>Peter looked and saw Elmer Hall approaching,
driving a pair of hogs before him. Taking
the cue, he talked about turkey eggs until the
grunts had died away in the distance.</p>

<p>Then said madam&mdash;"I didn't come to talk
about turkey eggs."</p>

<p>Peter drew a hand through his handsome
hair; looked down reflectively and looked up
smiling. "Will you come in?" he suggested.
A decided shake of the head answered that.
"My five years' seniority wouldn't excuse it&mdash;to
the Greenes and Aylors! I doubt if even
my mother could venture it. We may risk ten
minutes here at the gate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>Mistress Amanda began flicking her whip at a
thistle; her forehead gathering lines. Suddenly
the words shot from her:</p>

<p>"You are a patient man!"</p>

<p>"Well! You haven't come two miles to
tell me that?"</p>

<p>"But I have. Patience is a most unusual
virtue&mdash;in a man, but there is such a thing as
having too much of it. Do you remember the
story of the fox and the wolf?"</p>

<p>"The nursery tale? Let me see. I think
my grandmother used to tell it to me, but that
was long ago. I forget the point."</p>

<p>"The wolf bit him&mdash;put out his eyes, and so
on, the fox simply saying all the time, 'patience!'
Till finally the enemy tore his heart
out, and the fox found, too late, that patience
is the most dangerous of all virtues."</p>

<p>Peter gazed at the narrator of this fable in
amazement. For the first time in his life the
idea that women are incomprehensible found
lodgment in his mind.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see you think me daft," said his friend.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
And not for the first time in her life, by any
means, she found a man dense.</p>

<p>"In so many plain words, then, are you not
in love?"</p>

<p>The blood seemed on the point of bursting
through Peter's skin; his head weighed a
ton; his legs became pipe-stems. He gasped
something inarticulately. Then, manly sense
asserted itself. His look grew steady and grave
and nobody could have found fault with his
manner, as he said:</p>

<p>"You know I love your daughter. I reckon
everybody knows that."</p>

<p>Mistress Amanda turned impulsively. Her
face had been carefully averted during this
conversation, but now she let her eyes meet
his. There was the emphasis of a kept-down
excitement in her tone:</p>

<p>"Everybody except the one person who
ought to know it. It is a well-kept secret so
far as she's concerned."</p>

<p>"I've only been waiting for the right time&mdash;she's
so young&mdash;such a child!" Things danced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
in the sunshine before the man's eyes. His
long, lovely dream!&mdash;this was so sudden a call
to hard reality; he could not waken in a
minute.</p>

<p>"Nellie is not a girl to be won by accumulated
acts of worship," said Mistress Amanda
tersely. "Some girls can be won in that way;
romantic girls. They would be flattered at
being made the subject of verses; would like
to feel that a great, powerful creature trembled
before them. But Nellie is wonderfully free
from that sort of vanity. So far from understanding
the real feeling that is at the bottom
of all the favors you show her she looks upon
you as a sort of good godfather who has a
fanciful, half-playful preference for her. You
have never come near enough to her to touch
the ruling motive of her character."</p>

<p>It sprang to Peter's lips to ask what that
was; but he forbore the question. There
seemed to him an indelicacy in arriving at a
comprehension of his love through another
person's perceptions, even if that person was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
her mother. Mistress Amanda, however, was
no muddy stream whence truth must be laboriously
filtered out, but a clear fountain, throwing
facts high and rapidly in the air for the
dullest seer to take in.</p>

<p>"She has a large vein of the practical in her.
Probably you think&mdash;all you men think&mdash;that,
with that soaring look, her feet never touch the
ground. But you may take sentimental flights
into the region of romance for the next ten
years without interesting her enough to make
her even look to see where you are. Don't
woo her with poetry, my friend. She never
reads it. I never saw her with any book of
verse in her hand except a hymn-book."</p>

<p>A wild idea of putting his talent to this use
came to Peter. After a moment's reflection
he turned it out, as he would have locked his
barn door against a suspicious steed bearing
about him marks of gipsy ownership. And
herein did my honest hero show his Dutch descent
in his characteristic rejection of schemes
out of the range of his natural inclination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not much of a poet," he said, with an
effort at a laugh.</p>

<p>"You look at things rather too much from
a sentimental standpoint," observed Mistress
Amanda. She had beaten the thistle quite to
powder, and, laying down her whip, adjusted
her gauntlets and gathered the reins into a
firm grasp. Her fine black eyes had a singular
expression.</p>

<p>"Not too much for <i>some</i> women. The kind
of sentiment there is in you is the kind that
makes a man loyal, tender, and&mdash;of all things
the rarest!&mdash;appreciative toward the woman
you may marry. I wish girls were able to discriminate
between the shepherding qualities in
men and the huntsman's qualities. But they
like the sound of the horn and the dash of the
horses&mdash;the fiery eye and the masterful grip!
Only after their gallants have thrown aside all
their pretty trappings and come down to the
plain garb of the household boss do they learn
that a little kindness and consideration in a
husband outranks all the more showy qualities."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nellie certainly ain't one to be taken in by
a glittering outside&mdash;I sh'd think," Peter remarked.</p>

<p>"Not of the kind you have in your mind.
But she is peculiarly constituted&mdash;extremely
susceptible to anything like an appearance of
superiority of the moral sort; or, not so much
moral&mdash;I wish it was that!&mdash;but spiritual sort.
Some girls pine for a man to take them in hand
and lead them along the straight and narrow
path; and a thorny path their saintly director
generally manages to make it for them. Bah,
I've no patience with the 'Queechy' species of
hero!" exclaimed Mistress Amanda, lashing
her whip in the air. Her horse, however, had
sensibilities of his own, and taking this as a
definite appeal to his own intelligence he
started down the road at a pretty brisk pace,
carrying his mistress off with excellent stage
effect, her exit speech vibrating in Peter's astonished
ears.</p>

<p>He stood leaning upon the gate, after she
had turned the corner of the lane, for fifteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
minutes; his cheerful face clouded slightly as
he chewed the cud his friend had shown him,
gazing, ox-like, at the present surroundings
that lay about his feet, and unable to realize,
even after some effort, the meaning of the suggestions
that had been made as to possible
dangers lurking in the future.</p>

<p>There was a placidity about Peter amounting
to dulness, when he was pricked upon the matter
of threatened changes. Your light-weight
men, nervous, springy, and quick-glancing, are
full of apprehensions; they believe that it is
no more than likely that to-morrow may be
doomsday, and they prepare themselves even
for the most improbable crises. But two hundred
pounds gives a certain faith in the established
order of things, and it is a significant
fact that bulk and the conceit that the world
moves slowly, go together. Foretellers are so
apt to have a lean and meagre frame that I
should be loth to trust the pretensions of a
prophet over-endowed with flesh. So the fact
that Peter had a constitutional dislike to being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
stirred up to initiative acts must be laid to his
girth and his double chin; not to any lack of
fine feeling. His affection for Nellie had become
so much a part of himself that it partook
of his temperament, and was deliberate and
sober; incapable of sudden transitions. Adoring
her at a distance had the charm of familiarity,
and although in sentimental moods the
man liked to picture his star, his flower, as a
little housewife, seated of evenings by his side
before the fire, with some sewing in her dainty
fingers, and a tenderly inclined ear toward the
thing he might like to read to her; still, he had
grown so used to thinking of such scenes as
afar off that to be suddenly desired to look at
the necessity of at once taking steps to make
his dream a reality, or else to abandon hope of
ever making it one, was to ask too much of his
optimistic nature. For what is an optimist but
a person who believes that everything will turn
out all right; whether he chooses to go to
work at dawn or lie in bed till twelve?</p>

<p>But, Peter's indolence had a tinge of nobility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
in it. He saw a young girl, happy in her ignorance
of life's responsibilities, fresh, sweet,
and bright, with the reflection of her own innocent
and tender fancies shining in her unclouded
eyes, and he was loth to interpose his
tall shadow between her and the landscape.
His wish had been to stand aside until she
should come gradually to recognize him as an
agreeable feature of it, perhaps to learn to look
upon him as something indispensable to her
life, making a part&mdash;a large part of her happiness.
Some men of generous nature prefer to
have a woman turn toward them of her own
accord rather than to put forth the effort that
makes wooing an affair of capture. It is pretty
certain to happen, though, that the choice of a
man of this view is apt to fall upon a girl
whose instinct is not so much womanly as
feminine. And those who have studied woman-kind
will understand the distinction.</p>

<p>But Mistress Amanda's point had, nevertheless,
been made, for she had given Peter to
understand that there was a rival in the field.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
And the most optimistic of men does not fail
to experience certain sensations in his brain
extending to his strong right arm, when an intruder
threatens to snatch away the glass where
he is quietly watching the full bead gather and
waiting to raise it to his thirsting lips.</p>


<p class="center p2">IV.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Peter's thoughts had sought his rival they
would have found him at a certain fine old
mansion bearing upon the face of the stone
gate-post the name <span class="smcap">Roselawn</span>. A well shaded
drive swept up to the doorway, hospitably
broad, and in seasonable weather open, giving
a view of such a hall as can only be found in an
old southern house. Family portraits looked
down from the walls upon the carefully preserved
furniture, recognizing, it may be, with
some satisfaction, the presence of articles that
had been in favor during their lifetime.</p>

<p>It was Monday morning, and breakfast time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
according to the habits of the Armstrong
family. The judge was in his place, his wife,
comely, neat, and quiet, was in hers, and the
three daughters, Laura, Violet, and Bess, had
come in severally, and slipped into their chairs
after a warm greeting to their father and a
rather less impulsive and loving one to their
quiet mother.</p>

<p>"Miles not down?" said Violet, the sprightliest
of the sisters; a slim girl with a delicately
up-tilted face in which dark eyes and a saucily
curved mouth prepared one for good-humored
but probably pointed banter.</p>

<p>"Down!" repeated that personage, coming
in, and dropping discontentedly into the vacant
chair next to his mother. "If you had been
<i>up</i> and keeping your chickens in order instead
of&mdash;whatever else you were doing&mdash;I could
have got some sleep after four o'clock and been
down before. I wish you'd think proper to
order that black rooster made into fricassee," he
continued to his mother, who had no time to
reply, however, for Violet put in an instant protest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
for her pet Captain Jinks, who was such a
darling, and so intelligent he could do everything
except talk.</p>

<p>Miles dropped the subject, not caring to
compromise his dignity by a dispute over such
a trifle, but his entire bearing expressed that
appearance of unappreciated worth which is so
exasperating to women in a family; divining,
as they do, that the root of it is invariably
some kind of causeless irritation. The girls
discovered in a minute that Miles had "got
out of the wrong side of the bed" that morning;
this supplying a vague, kindly explanation
of his acerbities of temper. Undoubtedly he
was cross. It showed in his way of receiving
a remark that Laura now made. Laura was of
the languid type of fair women; heavy-lidded
gray eyes, peachy skin, and flesh all wrought into
curving lines. A subdued greed of pleasure is
the predominating quality of this sisterhood,
often existing under the perfect disguise of plaintive,
gentle renunciation. When thoroughly
understood they weep the profuse tears of spirits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
feeling themselves above the comprehension of
the ordinary mind.</p>

<p>"Please get Wash to hitch Peg-leg to the
phaeton right after breakfast, will you?" Laura
said. "I must drive over to Miss Annie's to
try on my dress she is making for the tournament."</p>

<p>The light of disapproval kindled in Miles'
grave face.</p>

<p>"Are you girls going to persist in attending
that silly entertainment?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"You certainly didn't used to think it silly,"
answered the one chiefly addressed. "Time
was&mdash;and not so very long ago, either&mdash;when
you rode at tournaments yourself! I haven't
forgotten the tournament at Manasses two
years ago, when we were visiting cousin Jennie
Davis"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But Miles' head had disappeared, following
his hands in a dive beneath the table for his
egg-cup, rolled off by a movement of his arm
that would have seemed scarcely accidental
could this young gentleman have been suspected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
of an ulterior wish to cut short some
embarrassing allusion. Every one is endowed
with some propensity tending to the discomfiture
of others. Laura's talent in this direction,
unknown to herself, lay in bringing up people's
outgrown inclinations; so keeping them to the
mortified level of a self they conceived they had
risen above and would fain forget. Reminiscences
of this kind are peculiarly afflicting to
young divines, to whom the problem of preserving
an appearance commensurate with the
severity of their doctrine is often in danger
from the good memories of their intimate
friends. Can we wonder that the ordained
preacher of twenty-two shrank sensitively from
reminders of the peccadilloes committed by the
gay youth of twenty?</p>

<p>Miles suffered, in the privacy of family life,
from the tendency to treat him as an ordinary
young man, whereas, he felt that he had become
remarkable. To be informed, at the instant of
assuming a superior tone, that he had been
used to joining in the customs he condemned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
was sufficiently humiliating. But Laura's observation
held a sting for his irritable conscience
that she had no idea of. The dropping of the
egg-cup had stopped her slow speech, for she
had an acute sense of sympathy for awkwardness
in a person ordinarily free from it, being
herself studiously graceful.</p>

<p>"Let Sally bring you another egg," she was
good enough to suggest. The yellow damsel
dawdling against the side table put herself to
some trouble to carry out the order, for the admiration
that was but lukewarm in the house
glowed effulgently in the kitchen; the young
preacher being idolized by the negroes.</p>

<p>But Miles' appetite had been satisfied. He
pushed back his plate and looked past his
offending sister into space; his mind taking a
flight in search of consolation ending at Benvenew,
making some pretty notes of a pair of
confiding eyes and a sweetly deferential tongue
that had never uttered a word hurtful to his
self-esteem. Of one devout disciple he was
sure. Mingled with his triumph in it was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
grateful acknowledgment of the immense advantage
in this connection of quality over quantity;
the sweetbriar rose being worth all the
rest of feminine creation.</p>

<p>"What's that about the tournament?" the
judge inquired. Three girlish voices chimed
an answer of which he extracted the gist at his
leisure; managing to arrive at the important
item, that Miles was setting himself above all
innocent amusements, and declined to accompany
his sisters to the tournament.</p>

<p>"Miles' nonsense be damned!" said the head
of the house. "I'll be your beau if he won't. I
reckon I'm young enough yet to go about with
all of you." The judge was forty-five, and excepting
for a little too much fulness of chin,
and a slight stiffness in his knees, he might have
passed for the handsome elder brother of his
son. Secretly, he was proud of the boy and
looked upon the extreme views he held as the
natural excess of an enthusiastic temperament
concentrating itself upon theology. He expected
Miles to grow more reasonable when his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
first zeal should have worn off. But his own
disposition was choleric, and while he was looking
forward to an amelioration of the strict
views held by the young preacher he was frequently
tempted to bluster a little upon their
points of difference.</p>

<p>The Armstrongs were rather given to disputations,
and the household atmosphere was not
seldom an uncomfortable one for the neutral
mother, who had positive opinions upon only
two subjects: the flavor of cookery and the
good looks of her husband. She was quite
satisfied that her son treated her respectfully,
that he had good manners, and that his clothes
set well; in less important points he was welcome
to follow his own inclinations. During
little clashes she was accustomed to occupy
herself with considerations about the next
dinner. Therefore, Miles was surprised to hear
her say:</p>

<p>"I think Miles is very much in the right in
not giving his countenance to tournaments.
As a minister, he couldn't. They bet on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
horses and betting's not right. I heard that
Penny Haywood bet fifty dollars last year and
lost. I'm sure, Judge, you wouldn't like Miles
to bet?"</p>

<p>The judge had given to this unwonted animation
the compliment of wide-open eyes and
smiling mouth.</p>

<p>"No danger of Miles betting!" he answered,
reassuringly. "All I ask is that he shouldn't
be so stiff-necked about his sisters taking their
enjoyment in the way of all young folks."</p>

<p>Miles had again betrayed singular discomfiture
at this new suggestion about himself.
The slow, faint color of one who colors seldom
and then from mortification, burned in his
cheeks, and he arose with a muttered excuse
and left the room, turning at the door to say:</p>

<p>"I'll have Peg-Leg put in the phaeton for
you, Laura."</p>

<p>The instinct to seek comfort for his wounded
self-love would have driven him straight to
Benvenew, but it was too early in the day, and
he had no excuse. The morning wore away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
tediously. Unhappily for the young man the
things that had once interested him and furnished
occupation for his spare hours were now
under the ban of his tyrant conscience. He
had embraced the course known as "setting a
good example," and for the sacrifices involved
he found recompense both in his own consciousness
of superiority and in the fact that
Nellie looked on and admired. Yet, if he was
in danger of becoming a prig, there were sound
faculties in him that made it quite as probable
that some sudden turn would swing him into
the path of practical usefulness. At home he
met at every turn with just the sort of opposition
to confirm his dislike of the easy self-indulgence
that swayed the rest.</p>

<p>Everybody else in the Armstrong family did
what he or she wished to do; it was for him to
do what he thought right, regardless of inclinations.
Laura was indolently selfish, Violet
energetically set upon carrying out her own
plans, and Bess, his junior by a year, was
strong-minded; something that in his view
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
was less endurable than pure frivolity. His
bitter admiration for her cleverness sometimes
found vent in expressions of solicitude for her
future husband, to which she always responded
that <i>his</i> wife would have her profound sympathy,
for his ideas of the family state were
founded upon Old Testament precedent, to
which the new dispensation and womanhood
were altogether opposed.</p>

<p>Sauntering discontentedly along the great
stretch of piazza Miles heard stray bits of his
sisters' talk as they sat at work, and contrasted
it with Nellie's sweet, sensible remarks, and
the feeling of her perfection grew strong in
him. Beginning in agreement of tastes and
opinions the intimacy between the two young
people had now reached the stage where conscious
preference may at any instant change to
blind attraction. Sedateness and dignity had
marked their intercourse so far; but the impulse
Miles felt swelling his breast was the first
rise of a wave capable of sweeping away all
the pretty dalliances of friendship, and of carrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
him out on the swift flowing sea of a
great passion. His was a temperament sure to
love ardently and he had not dissipated his
energies prematurely.</p>

<p>Two o'clock sees our young preacher
mounted on his Kentucky thoroughbred
mare, Stella, a beautiful chestnut, tractable
only with her owner. As he leaped into the
saddle she looked so knowing that he, to try
her, let the reins hang, and said softly, "To
Benvenew!" Whereupon the intelligent creature
gave her slender head a light toss, and
started off up the slope of the hill at a pace
that brought him, in less than an hour, to the
grand old park that surrounded that historic
mansion.</p>

<p>He had feared to find Nellie, as usual, surrounded
by the rest; but as he drew near the
little summer-house, covered with a luxuriant
grape-vine, now rich in purple clusters, he saw
her standing there, a basket on her arm, filling
it with the grapes. In a moment he was on
the ground beside her, Stella standing still,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
untied, and docile to his wish as an obedient
child.</p>

<p>At the first shy glance she gave him, Miles
forgot the smart to his vanity that had sent
him to her, forgot everything but that the
sweetest girl in the world stood there, blushing
under his fixed gaze, her little fingers trembling
in his grasp, for when she laid her hand in
his he suddenly found it impossible to let it
go.</p>

<p>"Come and sit down, please," he said, drawing
her inside the bower and seating himself
beside her on the rustic bench. "It is an age
since I saw you."</p>

<p>"Yesterday?" questioned Nellie, demurely
raising her brows.</p>

<p>"I don't count seeing you in a crowd. The
last time we really had any time together was
at the fair&mdash;away back in September. There
are so many things I have always wanted to
talk with you about. You are the only person
that has a real sympathy with me in the work
I am trying to do here, Miss Nellie. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
you don't know how dearly I value your sympathy."</p>

<p>Now, my innocent, modest beauty had
known what it is to hear manly voices sink
into tender cadence, declaring her sympathy
necessary to all their aims and enterprises in
life, nor had the deeper experience of that
special pleading, to which this is the preliminary,
been wanting. The practical sense her
mother had spoken of gave her intimation of
the thing that yet lay, half unsuspected, in the
depths of Armstrong's mind, like the sweet
arbutus under the smothering cedar. The cedar
here was the young man's egotism, claiming
attention as its right, and some storm wind
would have to sweep the prickly covering away
before the delicate blossoms of real love revealed
themselves.</p>

<p>And the storm wind was even at that moment
brewing. It is usually while we are most
free from forebodings, most satisfied with ourselves,
that the ugly head of misfortune thrusts
from around the corner and brings us with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
shock to a recognition that the past is perpetually
linking itself with the present, and that a
forgotten sin is capable of coming to life after
we have left it in the desert to starve.</p>

<p>Nellie had begun to murmur that she was
happy if anything she could do was a help to
him, when her soft speech was interrupted by
a flying scout from the house, a small negro
boy, whose bare heels scarcely rested upon the
ground while he delivered in emphatic voice a
message from Mistress Amanda:</p>

<p>"Miss Nell, yo's ter go straight ter th'
house, <i>ef</i> yo' please, ter say good-by ter Mr.
Beeswax afore he leaves. Lemme tote de
grapes."</p>

<p>The basket was seized, and the scout began
the march, looking back every instant to be
assured that the young pair followed.</p>

<p>They followed with vexation in the heart of
one, at least. To the other it was more of a
habit to submit her will to others, so her face
remained calm and her tones gentle as she replied
to the slight remarks Armstrong forced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
himself to make. At the door the scout left
them to deposit his burden in the kitchen and
go back after Stella, whom he was burning to
mount, not dreaming of the experience that
was in store for him.</p>

<p>The young pair entered the parlor and found
Mistress Amanda and old lady Powell entertaining
a short, keen-eyed, sallow man whose
age was not to be easily guessed. His occupation
might have been set down as mercantile,
and he was, in fact, a commercial drummer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Beesly, let me present you to Mr. Armstrong,
our minister," said Mistress Amanda,
formally.</p>

<p>The stranger bowed with ironical exaggeration.
"I have met Mr. Armstrong before," he
said, in what struck her as a disagreeably significant
tone. She gave a swift, searching look
at the young preacher.</p>

<p>Armstrong was standing with a rigid air of
dignity that sat not ill on his handsome person.
But he had suddenly grown very pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>


<p class="center p2">V.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> spoke well for Armstrong that, at the very
instant of running into a most unexpected and
disagreeable dilemma, he did not wish he had
been warned so that he might have avoided it.
A Gorgon would have been a winning object to
him in comparison with the wiry little man
now smiling a curiously double-faced smile at
him, but beyond the involuntary pallor that had
come he gave no sign of discomfiture; and
after a sharp glance to see how his salutation
had been met, Beesly turned away with a
mutter that lost itself in his bushy whiskers,
"true grit!" and began to make himself fascinating
to Nellie.</p>

<p>She had been sent for to bid this forty-second
cousin good-by, but now she was here he
seemed in no haste to depart. Leaving Armstrong
to the tender mercies of Mistress Amanda,
he followed the young girl over to her grandmother's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
sofa, where she had shyly taken
refuge, and drawing up a chair in front of the
two, bent himself to entertain.</p>

<p>No men have more facility in this line than
"drummers." They learn to observe human
nature and become adept at humorous description
of adventures, taking pains to tone their
note up or down to suit their company. It can
be a "bray" among other men, and a "coo"
with women. For the chaste ears of old lady
Powell, and her innocent granddaughter,
Beesly's talk was a light sparkle of harmless
fun that drew the laughter of both. Nellie
had a sense of fun&mdash;not humor&mdash;under her
demureness, and she was pleased and amused
as he meant her to be.</p>

<p>To the investigating glances Armstrong
threw toward her corner from time to time,
there was presented the singular spectacle of
the girl who had, but a few minutes before,
been blushing under his words of admiration,
seeming wholly content with the exchange of
another man's company for his own; even although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
she must have realized that an interview
had been interrupted which promised to
be an important one.</p>

<p>Important to the lady, Sir Egoist? Mark
her now, leaning back against the red silk
cushions, as Beesly bends eagerly forward in
the full swing of some fine narrative; the
dimpling smile showing a glimpse of even,
milk-white teeth behind a bud of a mouth,
dewily innocent as a baby's. The light in the
wily fellow's eyes is reflected in her hazel ones
as she catches the point of his sketch, and now
she hides her lovely face against her grandmother's
ample bosom, in an outburst of mirth
so rare with her as to seem almost indecorous.
Has it ever been your good fortune, Miles
Armstrong, to arouse so hearty an interest and
sway so readily that timid nature? She has
certainly forgotten you, and the serious business
of life you are so fond of discoursing with
her, in the glow of feelings natural to youth
and feminine love of enjoyment.</p>

<p>Armstrong's face grew gloomy, and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
conversation absent-minded, while Mistress
Amanda, taking note of everything, was led to
speculate on a set of possibilities that had
never before suggested themselves to her astute
intellect. Was it possible that the law of contrasts,
leading the fancies of men and maidens
to attach themselves to the persons most dissimilar,
could apply to her daughter Nellie, for
whom she had been anticipating a very different
inclination! Girls were capable of such
freaks. After all, if it were not for Peter
Weaver, the idea of Beesly as a permanent
member of the family would not be so unwelcome.
His shrewd sense and light views
formed a very good balance to the over-seriousness
of the young girl. Mingled with a pang
for her silent and devoted hero, Mistress
Amanda felt a certain satisfaction in this introduction
of a new player into her little domestic
drama. She became more affable with the
young preacher.</p>

<p>These two had never yet been able to strike
upon a single topic of mutual interest where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the clash of disagreement did not instantly
lead to silence.</p>

<p>"Let us harmonize upon the weather,"
Mistress Amanda had once observed when
argument had threatened to become personal.
But one cannot always talk about the weather.
She tried apples.</p>

<p>"Is your father shipping his usual quantity
of golden pippins to England this fall? I
hear that he has had the honor of furnishing
some to the queen's own table; that her preference
is for pippins."</p>

<p>"Three thousand barrels, I believe," said
Armstrong, in a lukewarm response.</p>

<p>"Indeed! That means quite a nice return
in money;" her tone had a tinge of regret for
her own exclusion from so excellent a business
arrangement. The orchard at Benvenew was a
fairly fine one, but its full resources were undeveloped
for lack of capital. If she had the
money Mistress Amanda felt sure she might
rival the success of the master of Roselawn,
who was rolling up a fortune before the admiring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
eyes of his neighbors. Envy of a
neighbor's superior success is not a Virginian
trait. All your true Virginian asks for is the
tithe due to friendship and he will put hands
in pockets and look on while the enterprising
compatriot piles up his dollars. But, being a
woman, Benvenew's mistress could not and
did not try to suppress the emulative instinct
that made her long for an opportunity to prove
her business capacity.</p>

<p>Beesly's ears, sharp as a hunter's, had caught
the word "money," and with his quick way of
whirling about, he threw a sentence toward the
other guest.</p>

<p>"By the way, talking of money, Armstrong,
it's kind of curious, isn't it?&mdash;But, never mind,
we'll have a chance to discuss that going
home. What I was going to tell you was
about the wedding of the turkey-girl in the
Tennessee mountains," he continued, turning
back with equal suddenness to his old and
young auditors, who had scarcely had time to
follow his flight with their eyes before he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
with them again, fluent as a blackbird rehearsing
a well-practised theme.</p>

<p>Was it a malicious impulse suddenly checked
by compunction for the man he was "cutting
out," and toward whom decency demanded at
least the avoidance of insult upon the top of
injury? Or was it a mere random arrow from
his whimsical quiver that had made the young
preacher start and redden, while his deep eyes
began to burn with an intense fire that promised
some strong kind of entertainment for the
person proposing to accompany him "home."</p>

<p>Whichever it was, Armstrong now made up
his mind that as his object in coming to Benvenew
had been defeated, he would, at least,
take the initiative in breaking up that little
<i>s√©ance</i> yonder, toward which he felt unsanctified
resentment.</p>

<p>He arose. At the movement old lady Powell,
whose pleasure in the vivacity of her entertainer
had been more than once disturbed
by the feeling that she was not paying proper
attention to her minister, gently released herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
from her granddaughter's encircling arm,
and came towards him.</p>

<p>"You shorely ain't thinkin' o' goin', <i>yit</i>,
Mr. Armstrong? Why, we hain't seen nothin'
o' you yit, and it's seldom enough you come.
Stay to tea, now! Mandy, do press Mr. Armstrong
to stay to tea!"</p>

<p>"Will sally-lunn tempt you?" smiled Mistress
Amanda, choosing always to suppose
that the proper appeal to men was through
appetite. But she overlooked the counterpoise
of sentiment when a man is under
twenty-five. Armstrong remained standing.
A word from Nellie might have changed his
mind, but although she looked at him she did
not speak; and, unfortunately, Beesly did.
His high-pitched voice made his interference
doubly offensive to the young preacher's refined
sensibilities.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Armstrong, I'm not ready to go.
Tea-time at Benvenew has peculiar seductions,"
and he pointed the remark by a smile at Nellie
that some observers might have called frank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
and kind; others, devilish. So much depends
upon the point of view. Armstrong's was that
of the harsher criticism; not to be wondered
at, considering the difference in his feelings on
entering and departing from Benvenew that day.</p>

<p>"I am not aware sir, that my going places
any constraint upon you," said Armstrong with
the most distant air a man could assume.</p>

<p>Beesly laughed. What defense is dignity
against a laugh, with which the company, ignorant
of any occult meaning, show an inclination
to join, moved both by sympathy with the
joker and the polite wish to smooth over a
little difficulty between two guests! Armstrong
realized keenly that he was at extreme disadvantage,
since the animosity that he felt toward
Beesly could not be explained and must
bear the semblance of ill-temper. That it
might be interpreted as jealousy did not occur
to him. It was, however, natural that the
women should take this view of it.</p>

<p>Now, Nellie, with all her good and sensible
qualities, had one little foible. She was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
aware of it, and, indeed, her position as the
recognized beauty of the county was so certain
to develop the trait in any young woman not
altogether an angel, that she is excusable for
having grown just a little bit vain. Hers was
not the vanity of dwelling in thought upon her
own attractions, for, in moments of deliberate
reflection, she was given to a humble estimate
of herself; but it was the innocent, childlike
love of notice, and of the subtle flattery conveyed
in being sought out and distinguished
by attention. Maiden-like, she fled to corners,
and woman-like there was pleasure in being
followed. The boldest admirer was likely
then to gain the ear of modesty that had this
susceptible spot in it.</p>

<p>Beesly was wise in making of his small, active
person a very bulwark against the outer
world; his play of wit so filling the space that
the girl only saw dimly what was going on outside
her corner. She looked up to find the
preacher's fine form drawn up before her. He
persisted in going. His somber eyes meant to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
convey to her that this was something more
than an ordinary good-by.</p>

<p>The ubiquitous Beesly gave her no opportunity
to realize the situation. A cool clasp of
her little fingers, a bow, and Armstrong was
gone from the room.</p>

<p>Then Beesly sprang up, with a good-humored
show of despair. "Plague the fellow!&mdash;if he
<i>will</i> go, I must tear myself away. I have something
particular to say to him, and to-morrow
I start for Chicago. I'll be back in a week or
so, though, Cousin Amanda, and you can order
the sally-lunn then."</p>

<p>He shook hands all around, his jolly, hearty
manner contrasting forcibly with the seriousness
of the other, and departed, leaving a track
of glittering light behind him, as some persons
do. What matter if the glitter is a tinsel clap-trap?
Nonsense helps to make life cheerful,
and a jolly good fellow is especially a boon in
country society.</p>

<p>Mistress Amanda went to the window and
began dropping the muslin curtains. She liked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
to put this veil between the outer dusk and
the fire-lit room.</p>

<p>"Heigho!" she yawned; "'what fools these
men be.'"</p>

<p>"<i>Mortals</i>, mamma, I think," was the gentle
correction of Nellie.</p>

<p>Her astonished mother stared. "What
do you know of Shakespeare?" she ejaculated.</p>

<p>The young girl blushed. "Papa used to
read to us in the evenings sometimes. Have
you forgotten, mamma? I recollect Midsummer
Night's Dream very well."</p>

<p>Her mother spent several minutes in silent
reflection, studying her daughter. "I don't
know that I understand you as well as I
thought I did," she then observed, with unusual
softness.</p>

<p>Nellie came around to the back of her chair,
putting a soft hand on her shoulder. "But
you love me, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Love you?" Mistress Amanda's splendid
eyes grew moist. "Yes, dear, I love you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
dearly. All the good that can come to me in
this world is to see you happy."</p>

<p>"That's right, Mandy," said old lady Powell
cheerily. "But you's young enough, child, to
see a heap o' satisfaction on yo' own account,
yit."</p>

<p>A little negro boy, sprawling on the floor of
his mammy's cabin, and rubbing his back as he
could reach it, might have told Mr. Beesly
something about the paces of the mare, Stella,
which that gentleman was trying to catch up
with. A start of five minutes was too much in
Stella's favor, if her master had intended flight
from his persistent acquaintance. When the
little man swung himself into his saddle, and
looked here and there and everywhere in the
fast-gathering dusk for the sight of a horseman
in the road ahead, there was nothing whatever
to be seen.</p>

<p>Beesly was a poor rider, on a strange, borrowed
horse, and the country was unfamiliar to
him. Twenty paces from Benvenew the road
forked, and the commercial traveler had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the slightest idea which path to take. Invoking
good luck, he took the one to the left. It
went past a farm-house or two, where the
hungry fellow saw lights twinkling in kitchens,
and smelled&mdash;in imagination&mdash;the odor of
squirrel-stew and corn-pone. After this he
passed the old mill, and the outlook grew less
promising.</p>

<p>"A plague upon him!" cried the baffled
pursuer. "I didn't think Armstrong was the
man to run away. What did he take me for,
anyway?"</p>

<p>Darkness comes rapidly in these mountains.
Beesly found himself skirmishing around in a
curiously eccentric style, and the certainty that
he was entirely astray gained his slow credence.
He was not fortified by a good meal, either, to
enjoy the cool night breeze that began to play
through his light summer suit.</p>

<p>"Get along! Go somewhere, I don't care
where, so it leads to supper!" he apostrophized
the horse, and that animal, left to his own judgment,
bethought himself of a certain hospitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
stable where more than once he had had a good
meal when business led him in the direction of
its owner. So, taking a start, he cantered along
the road at a very creditable pace, and paused
of his own accord in front of Peter Weaver's
gate.</p>

<p>The front windows of Peter's cottage were
wide open, and Beesly had a view of a big
man in his shirt-sleeves going around a well-lit
room, holding a book in his hand, and singing
at the top of an exceedingly powerful voice.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Hallo in there!" shouted Beesly's
thin falsetto, and presently it dawned upon
Peter's comprehension that somebody outside
was trying to make himself heard. He came
to the door, holding a lamp high above his
head, the light casting into relief his ruddy face
and Titan-like frame.</p>

<p>"A handsome fellow, by heaven!" thought
the drummer, who never lost a picturesque feature.</p>

<p>"Can a gentleman who has lost his way beg
the favor of an hour's rest and a bit of supper?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
he sang out toward the Titan, who responded
with a hearty:</p>

<p>"Sartain, sir! And most welcome. 'Light
and come right in. I'll send a nigger after
your horse."</p>

<p>"I'm a distant cousin of Mistress Amanda,
up to Benvenew," said Beesly, as he entered
the cottage and proceeded to make himself at
home in his usual easy fashion. "I insisted on
leaving there before supper, and have been
properly punished by losing my way."</p>

<p>"Cousin to Mistress Amanda? That gives
you a claim on me, sir, to any extent," said
Peter, throwing a log on the fire, and calling
out the back door to his cook to hurry up supper.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," he continued, "living all by
myself here I've fallen into the way of kind o'
having meals at any hour I like, and supper's
ruther put back to-night. I'm glad it's so, as
I've the good fortune to have yo' company."</p>

<p>"Why, I had an idea that I might take supper
along with your preacher here, Mr. Miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Armstrong, but if you'll believe me, he went off
and left me in the lurch, although I had something
very particular to say to him."</p>

<p>"Possible!" ejaculated Peter, his face becoming
thoughtful.</p>

<p>Loquaciousness was Beesly's prime vice.
He felt himself aggrieved in this instance, and,
convinced by the appearance of a bountiful
supper that his host was a good fellow, and entitled
to confidence, he poured out a tale that
had the unintended effect of impairing Peter's
appetite.</p>

<p>"You see&mdash;it's this way. Three years back
now&mdash;Armstrong was a minor, anyway, and
not responsible for the money if he chose to
put it that way. But he put a bet on Belle
Noir&mdash;a pretty big bet&mdash;we fellows sort o'
goaded him to it,&mdash;and he lost. Plumb five
hundred dollars he lost, sir! And if you'll believe
me, he wrote a letter to Keats&mdash;Keats
backed Charlie Boy&mdash;saying he had no mind
to ask his governor for the money, that betting
was against his conscience, anyway, but that, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
his honor demanded that he pay up, he earnestly
requested for time to do it in. Well,
Keats said he'd give him time. He was going
abroad and he'd give him till he came back.
Now, sir, that was three years ago, and Armstrong's
never given a sign. I met Keats in
New York last week, and he said he meant to
come down here and see Armstrong. He says
he hates a sneak. That's what I meant to tell
Armstrong to-night; that Keats is coming
here. You see, nobody knows a word about it
but us three. By the bye, I guess you'd better
not mention it. I don't want to make trouble."</p>

<p>"You certainly have astounded me, sir,"
affirmed Peter Weaver. "Mr. Armstrong's the
very last person I'd have suspected of ever getting
into such a box as this. And five hundred
dollars, too. That's a mighty big lot of
money to throw away."</p>

<p>"If he's saving up his salary to pay it it'll
take him rather awhile to get it together,"
grinned Beesly. "What does he get for preaching?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>"We pay our preacher two hundred and
fifty dollars a year, sir. And perquisites," he
added, as the drummer gave a significant
whistle. "There are perquisites&mdash;there'd be
more if he got married"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will before long. There are
pretty gals down here. Cousin Amanda's girl
is a thundering beauty. I shouldn't wonder if
Armstrong had got his eyes set that way.
Little mite strait-laced, though, is Nellie.
By George, what'd she say if she knew the
preacher used to bet on horses? Reformed,
didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Armstrong's said to have experienced
sanctification," said Peter, slowly.</p>

<p>"Oh, come, now, that's too good," shouted
the commercial traveler.</p>

<p>"There may be such a thing; I'm called
skeptical myself. But whether there is or not,
there's goodness. And for my part, I believe
Mr. Armstrong's an upright, moral, well-meaning
man, and it's the duty of his friends to
stand by him," said Peter Weaver. But deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
down in his heart was a cry. The preacher was,
then, in love with Nellie: did Nellie love the
preacher?</p>


<p class="center p2">VI.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hardest thing in the world to bear is
self-contempt. The man or woman who has
once slipped from his own standard of rectitude&mdash;whatever
it is&mdash;has henceforth in his soul a
little Inferno where desperate desire is continually
carrying a huge stone up a hill and memory
is as continually rolling it down again.</p>

<p>Armstrong's thoughts shaped themselves
into some such words as these as he galloped
out from Benvenew. He was not running from
Beesly through any cowardly impulse; but because
he wanted to think the matter all out,
alone. The moment he had laid eyes on the
fellow he knew that the thing he had been
fighting down so long, overlaying by a structure
of self-denial and good deeds, had come uppermost
in the foreground of his life, and must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
be faced as a sin freshly committed, because to
the present hour concealed. The young man
had a strong nature, proud and tender; a little
one-sided in its development, and the more
likely to cut out intense suffering for itself
through the aid of imagination. When conscience
lashed he had no instinct to shrink
away and make excuse; instead, he cried
"Peccavi!" feeling that he deserved the more
because no one but himself knew that he deserved
it. Herein, although circumstances may
have made it appear that he was nearly, if not
quite, a hypocrite, Miles Armstrong proved
himself none, for he felt that the worst of a
sin was in its commission, not in the fact of its
being made public. It would have been a relief
to him all along if that gambling experience
in his past, when, for a brief space he had
sowed wild oats, could have been known to all
the world; then he might have shouldered
blame, lived the matter down, and started
afresh, with a clear page for the future. But
expediency had been his counselor. She had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
whispered that his usefulness would be impaired
if he let himself appear as a common
youth; a preacher should be in a certain sense,
immaculate; his faults and follies were between
himself and his conscience. What he <i>had</i> been
was not the world's business; only what he
was <i>now</i>.</p>

<p>And so Armstrong had concealed his fault
and gone on trying to forget it, but never able
to do so, until, between looking on the picture
of what he was believed to be, and what he
was in his own knowledge of himself, the great
contrast took the form of an accusation that
made him out&mdash;liar: of all things the meanest
and most despicable when the lie is one which
assumes the appearance of a virtue that a man
has not.</p>

<p>To the sky the young preacher turned his
face, worn in a few hours to the sharp outlines
of pain, and in the dusk and loneliness of that
mountain path, over which Stella was swiftly
bearing him home, he made a vow in his heart
that from this hour he would cease to be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
slave of the Lie. He would descend, before
the eyes of men and women, into the valley
of humiliation, that he might emerge a free
soul, even if he must in consequence go on
with his life stripped of all that made it pleasant
and useful.</p>

<p>And then Miles, lifting his hat as if bidding
farewell to something beloved, rode calmly on
to Roselawn.</p>

<p>Again, the little church beside Sneaking
Creek was crowded as upon the Sunday the
young preacher had given his first sermon.
Some indefinite rumor had got abroad of a
surprise in store for the congregation; how
started it would be difficult to say, and nobody
had the slightest idea of what he expected;
only there was an atmosphere of expectancy.</p>

<p>All the Armstrong family were at church,
the Judge resplendent with a purple necktie,
and his wife in a purple silk; the girls, as
usual, attired with taste and at considerable expense.
Mistress Amanda and her mother were
in their pew, with Nellie between them, charming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
as the spirit of October, in a carefully
turned claret-colored poplin and a toque
trimmed with autumn leaves. And Peter
Weaver was there; with a dubious expression,
and very sore in mind; wishing to believe the
best of people under adverse circumstances, and
nobly ready to put himself out of the question
if he must do so to make little Nellie happy.</p>

<p>There was a peculiar stillness as Armstrong
arose after the hymn that heralded the sermon.
The young man's pale, tense look produced a
general sensation of anxiety. Some good
mothers in Israel were for handing him up
their smelling salts. Girls scrutinized his features
with their mouths falling apart, wondering
what dreadful thing had happened to him to
make his lips so set and his eyes so deep and
black. But all turned their faces toward him
with the sure response of sympathy toward
unaffected feeling.</p>

<p>"My people!"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The words were those of an old minister,
grown gray in service among loved friends;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
but they came earnest and unstudied from the
heart of the young preacher. Hearts thrilled
to him, answering the strangely sweet appeal
that breathed through the notes of that fine
voice, always beautiful in its modulations, but
to-day with a new quality that won without his
hearers knowing why.</p>

<p>"You have come for a sermon," Armstrong
went on. "I have no sermon to give you.
When you elected me to serve as the minister
of this church I had joy in taking the place you
gave me. I love the work. At this instant,
when I am about to give it up, every fibre of
my nature clings to it, my heart and my mind
as well. Yet I must give it up. I am not
worthy to be your minister; nor <i>now</i>, to be a
minister at all. And the reason is this. Some
time ago, before I was ordained, I was for a
season given over to ungodliness. I fell into
one sin that by heaven's grace did not lead to
worse, as it might have done. It was not a
thing most of you would call very bad"&mdash;the
proud Armstrong blood made the speaker's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
head rear slightly. He felt his father's angry
eyes upon him and even imagined he heard
the word "fool"; but he sternly went on:</p>

<p>"We southerners are too apt to look with
indulgence upon social sins. Horse-racing and
gambling are things you might consider excusable
in a young man, even in one meaning to
be a minister. These were my failings. I
don't exaggerate them so much as to say that
because I did these things I am unfit to serve
as your minister. No; it is not that."</p>

<p>A deep breath labored through his lungs,
and the many staring eyes in front of him all
seemed to swim together and take on the form
of a question. What was it, then? What was
to come?</p>

<p>"The first duty of any soul is to be thoroughly
honest," continued the young preacher.
"He who glosses over his own faults and acts
as if he had a guiltless past behind him helps
to spread the fell disease of deceit and hypocrisy;
the great pest of our times. And of this
baseness I have been guilty. I let it be supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
that I had experienced sanctification. I
came before you unconfessed and with a semblance
of uprightness it was not my privilege
to claim. All men are sinners, and it is the
nature of some not to feel their sins acutely;
they can go about with light hearts, never
aware of the yoke a Christian should bear.
But others are different. Every man according
to his nature. We can only be guided by
the light within. But wo to that man who
wilfully shuts his eyes to the revelation of his
own conscience! St. Paul felt the weight of
his sins upon his soul and bravely cried out, 'I
am the chief of sinners!' He made the world
see him just as he was, not pretending goodness
that did not belong to him. This is the
right thing to do; above all, the right and
only thing for a teacher of men to do. I have
always felt this, and have acted contrary to my
convictions. I have lived a lie before you.
Now, for the first time you see me as I am and
know that I am not what you thought me. It
is the just punishment of one who 'knows the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
right and chooses the wrong,' to lose all he has
sought to gain. I lose what I value most in
giving up my privilege of usefulness among
you. But it is my duty to do this, and I dare
not shrink from it because it is hard."</p>

<p>Soldiers know that valor is born in the heat
of strife, called out by the sight of waving banners,
the note of bugles, and the feeling of a
great mass rushing all together against a foe.
A far greater effort of courage is made by
the man who deliberately stands up before his
friends and makes a confession that may in an
instant turn their esteem to contempt, and
leave him alone and defenseless among a host
of accusers. In making his supreme effort
Armstrong had not been blind to this probable
result. His imagination had vividly pictured
the moment of his humiliation. Nerved to
carry the thing through, his voice uttered the
final word without a falter. Then, stepping
back, he sat down.</p>

<p>Every sort of confusion prevailed. The
general feeling was that of excitement and astonishment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
especially among the younger set.
Very few were able to appreciate the strange
manifestation of moral greatness that had been
made before them; and with these the uppermost
sensation was that of awkwardness. Bluff old
farmers had grown red and uneasy, aware that
their young preacher had climbed to a height
where they could not approach him. They
shuffled their feet and looked down. The
women whispered; some tittered hysterically.
One got up and crossed the church to say
something to a friend. It was the signal for a
general movement, and in a few moments
nearly everybody had changed their places.
Armstrong, with his fingers over his closed eyes,
saw nothing, but he felt terrible vibrations in
his brain. He was alone; deserted. In a
single moment of suffering years can be compressed,
and a sensitive nature grows old fast.</p>

<p>There was a light touch upon his arm, a touch
that thrilled him through and through. He
looked, and standing beside him was beautiful
Nellie; shy, shrinking Nellie, always dreading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
any conspicuous position, and wont to hide behind
her mother's ample shadow. She was upon
the platform, holding out her small, ungloved
hand, her eyes shining through tears, her cheeks
flushed rosy red; forgetful of shyness, all
thought of self lost in the outburst of sympathy
and reverence that had led her feet straight to
him her heart called lover, leader and highest
among men.</p>

<p>The young preacher's sunken eyes gleamed
with a new, wonderful hope. They devoured
the sweet face. Her hand was caught and
held, pressed hard while he whispered, "Nellie,
love!" and then, mindful of the staring people,
Armstrong would have swept her quickly
back, but the young girl felt to her very finger-tips
the sense of that great stare. Her head
dropped, her form trembled, the roses in her
cheeks turned to fire, and shrinking, faltering, on
the verge of a burst of weeping, she turned and
hid her face on the young preacher's breast!</p>

<p>Scarcely a second was given to the people to
take this sight in before Peter Weaver's huge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
form towered on the platform in front of the
young pair. He had hastened, almost leaped
up the steps, and behind him Nellie fled to the
little door at the side of the platform and so
out from the church. One great throb of pain
had Peter's heart given at sight of Nellie on
Armstrong's breast, one strong, silent effort of
renunciation of a lifetime's hopes he made, and
then self was put behind him, for good and all.
He had a duty to perform, and he did it with
his might.</p>

<p>"I want to say a word or two!" his great
voice sang out, silencing the clamor and confusion
in another thrill of curiosity.</p>

<p>"I ain't a speaker, as you all know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A comment from the rear chimed in, "You're
a poet!" It was Penny Haywood, and Violet
Armstrong, hanging upon his arm, quickly
forced him to be silent.</p>

<p>"But there air facts in nature that speak for
themselves, and don't require eloquent speech-making
to get people to understand 'em. One
of these facts is a good man. There are lots of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
good women&mdash;God bless 'em!&mdash;and some pretty
good men in an all 'round way. But the rarest
thing on all of God's earth is a thoroughly good,
honest man; one whose acts air as transparent
as daylight, that stands up before his fellows
clean and sound, and dares to father everything
he has ever done in his life, without shamming
or palliating anything. You know it was this
kind of an honest man that old Diogenes went
'round seeking with a lantern and couldn't find.
Well, if he'd come seeking him in Fauquier
County, Virginia, he'd have found him right
here in the Second Baptist church, and his
name's Miles Armstrong!"</p>

<p>"Good!" pronounced a woman's voice; Miss
Lavinia Powell, not afraid to speak her mind,
and esteeming it a rare privilege to assent to a
man's common-sense.</p>

<p>"I consider, ladies and gentlemen, that we've
had here before us to-day an exhibition of high
and fine moral feeling that ought to be a lesson
to us all our lives. And as for the modesty of
the man that's given it, and his idea of being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
unworthy to go on preaching to us and all that,
why, I say&mdash;I say that there ain't another as
worthy one to be found anywhere, and if you're
of my mind, we'll go right on having Mr. Miles
Armstrong preach to us as long as he lives!
And what's more," shouted Peter, while he unnecessarily
reared himself a-tip-toe, "I'm darned
if I think it'll hurt the church a bit if, to crown
this occasion, you all join in a cheer of good-will
to our preacher, Mr. Miles Armstrong and Miss
Nellie Thomas, his wife&mdash;that's-to-be!"</p>

<p>Then there was laughing and acclamation,
and crowding toward the platform, and the
young preacher's hand was seized and wrung
until his fingers ached, and his bewildered brain
ceased to think at all, but left him altogether
at the mercy of his friends, who nearly tore him
to pieces in their zeal.</p>

<p>Peter Weaver for once asserted himself and
claimed the privilege of driving the young
preacher to Benvenew&mdash;where he was panting to
go after Nellie&mdash;in his own high top buggy.
He had something to say in private.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's this," said Peter, laying his broad hand
earnestly on the young man's knee, when they
were well along on the road and no one was
near. "I knew about the thing you've been
taking so hard, before you told of it to-day.
Beesly told me. Now, my dear sir, you want
money. You don't want to ask your father for
it. No need. You've done enough. Let me
help you out o' this leetle scrape. I've more
money than I know what to do with. I've got
five hundred dollars right here, in this little
roll, and I want you to take it. Not as a loan;
as a gift. Do, now!"</p>

<p>Armstrong protested, thanked him with no
lack of warmest gratitude, but absolutely refused.
His father was rich, he said, and would
help him. His road was easy before him now,
easier than he deserved. All Peter could think
of to console himself was that he would buy
Nellie a wedding present with the money.</p>

<p>Shame-faced little Nellie, hiding behind the
parlor curtains, longing for Armstrong, and
fearing to have him come! How quickly he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
found her and carried her triumphantly to that
distant corner where a great black horse-hair
sofa swallowed them up; the worn horse-hair
so slippery that he had to put his arm around
her to hold her on.</p>

<p>Mistress Amanda was a dumfounded woman.
So swiftly and suddenly had come the
surprises of that morning that all she could do
was to contemplate her daughter from a distance,
and say "Well!" in a tone that meant
resignation to circumstances.</p>

<p>But she had had her proud moment. Her
heart&mdash;warm and true yet after bitter life-experiences&mdash;had
leaped with delight when Peter
Weaver made the little speech that with her
knowledge of him, showed him a hero, capable
of the most generous sacrifice it is within the
power of a man to make. "Hero," she called
him, to honest Peter's immense confusion, as
they sat sedately in two armchairs before the
fire, with their backs to the young couple in the
far corner of the spacious room; talking over
the details of the great occurrence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>"For such a sensible woman you air given to
making too much of the little things men do
that air right to do," said Peter, smiling.</p>

<p>"So few men do the little things that are
right," sighed Mistress Amanda, looking at her
own past in the bed of fire. "You are the only
man I know, Peter, that I would put a heavy
stake on to take the straight course every
time."</p>

<p>"What, leave out Armstrong?" remonstrated
Peter, with a jerk of his head backward
toward the corner.</p>

<p>"Armstrong has come upon me too suddenly,"
complained Mistress Amanda. Then,
with the generosity of a candid nature she paid
rightful tribute to what commanded her admiration.</p>

<p>"He is certainly an excellent young man,"
she said. "A noble fellow. I've thought of
him more than once as you spoke of him in that
speech of yours,&mdash;'the man Diogenes sought!'
I trust he will make my little Nellie happy."</p>

<p>"She has that within her that ensures happiness,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
said Peter steadily. "The sweetest,
soundest heart ever a woman had. Heaven
bless her!"</p>

<p>Mistress Amanda softly stretched out her
firm, shapely hand, and laid it on his own as
it rested on the arm of the chair. It was a
friendly, sympathetic touch. Perhaps unawares,
something more went into it than she
intended.</p>

<p>Peter looked at her with great kindness.</p>

<p>"You and me air getting to be middle-aged
people, Amanda," he said. "The chief thing
now is for us to make the young people happy."</p>

<p>But old lady Powell, apparently dozing in her
chair on the opposite side of the fire was building
a double air-castle. She said to herself
that Peter's little green cottage would suit the
young preacher and his bride very well, if its
master should come to Benvenew to live.
Nothing was more likely. And Amanda and
Peter would just hit it off together. Everybody
could see that. It was perfectly plain.</p>

<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Margaret Danvers</span> stepped aboard the
southern-bound sleeper at Chicago one stormy
March evening, and as she walked composedly
to her berth in the middle of the car, the eyes
of every person present were riveted upon her.
She wore a closely fitting garment of Russian
sable, which enveloped her completely, and a
large beaver hat with drooping plumes, and
from the single fine diamond flashing at her
throat to the tips of her dainty Su√©de boots she
looked the model of a fashionable beauty. She
was the only woman on the car, and before she
had fairly settled herself comfortably, all the
men had mentally pronounced their opinion of
her looks and style, and hazarded a conjecture
as to her age. Her attendant, a florid man of
middle age, received the slight degree of attention</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>
<p>justified by his seeming only an adjunct of
the moment. As he left her, he put into her
hands a bunch of costly roses, which she received
with a smile and laid upon the opposite
seat the instant he was gone.</p>

<p>Of the score of passengers, two or three
knew her by sight, for she was, in a way, a public
character, but, as it happened, none were
really acquainted with her, and before long
even those most deeply interested in her appearance
yielded to the apathy peculiar to
sleeping-cars, and subsided into their newspapers
or their rugs, preparing to wear out the
evening until bedtime.</p>

<p>Margaret amused herself in watching the flying
snow and in reverie. Too used to traveling
to even care to look about her, she yielded to the
prevailing somnambulistic influence just enough
to dream without sleeping. At first there
was in her mind a confusion of events past, present,
and to come. Incidents of no importance
mingled with greater ones, and her reflections
became mixed with little fanciful suggestions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
of things long since forgotten, or, rather, voluntarily
put out of mind. She tried to think
of her career, to recall her triumphs, and to
dwell upon the possibilities of the future. She
told herself that music was her life, that all she
had to do with was the beautiful and the divine
in art, and that the everyday existence she had
struggled to rise above was henceforth nothing
more than an unpleasant memory.</p>

<p>At twenty-eight she was her own mistress,
earning an independent income through the
use of her beautiful voice. The teaching days
and the drudgery of the class-room had passed,
and as a concert singer she was favorably known
in more than one western city noted for its
critical taste. After a successful winter in Milwaukee
and Chicago, she was now upon her way
to fulfil an engagement in Baltimore, which
promised more than anything in which she had
yet engaged. She was in the heyday of her
powers, admired, in radiant health, conscious
of her beauty and talent, and entirely satisfied
with life. What did it mean that, as she looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
from the window with a proud smile upon her
lips, some tantalizing thoughts should intrude
themselves, and the mind so entirely self-poised
should feel, for the first time in years, the
weakening influence of some emotional fancies?
It was her boast that she was never lonely,
never sad, that her whole heart was in the
work.</p>

<p>The conductor passed through taking tickets,
and brought her back to the present. And
after this came the little stir of the porter making
up the berths, and she moved to the end
of the car. In front two men were talking.</p>

<p>"Never saw a promise of a worse storm,"
said one. "Shouldn't wonder if the tracks
were blocked a little ahead."</p>

<p>"Comes from the southwest," suggested the
other. "If necessary, they'll put on another
locomotive. We're bound to get through at
any rate on this train; that's one comfort."</p>

<p>By nine o'clock Margaret, enveloped in a
downy wrapper of dark red, lay courting sleep
in her section. Over her was spread the fur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
ulster, none too warm above the blankets, even
for her warm blood. The thermometer outside
would have registered zero, and whiffs of icy
air found their way every now and then into
the car. Everything was quiet save her
thoughts, which began to utter themselves with
loud, importunate voices, as if answering some
call without, independent of her control. "I
have happily been able to say all my life that
I didn't know what nerves were," said Margaret
to herself, "but I begin to think that from some
inexplicable cause I am nervous."</p>

<p>"Richard Allen!" She started as if the
words had been spoken in her ear. Swiftly
memory flew back ten years, and she saw herself
standing bareheaded at the gate of her
father's house in dear old Leesburg, Virginia,
where her childhood had been passed; and beside
her, bending tenderly to catch her lightest
word, the form of her first lover, then a poor,
obscure young lieutenant in the army. With
an indifference scarce tinged with pity, since it
hardly occurred to her in those days that men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
could really feel, she had met his pleading affection
with an enthusiastic outburst of her
ambition to lead the artist's life, to spend her
energies in self-development, and show what a
woman wholly devoted to an intellectual and artistic
career might become. They had sung in
the choir together, had mingled their voices in
moments when, inspired by devotional ecstasy,
it seemed that the two spirits united into one,
in that mysterious fellowship which belongs
alike to religion and to love. And yet she had
no feeling for him above regard: no feeling for
any one, for anything, but art.</p>

<p>"You must not think I am deficient in
womanly sensibility," she had said to him, with
one of those soft glances of the meaning and
effect of which she was entirely careless and
unconscious. "But some women must remain
spinsters, you know, and I think I am meant to
be one of the sisterhood."</p>

<p>"You do not know yourself. The day will
come when ambition will seem nothing to you;
when the homely things, the real things, will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
take on their true value to your eyes, and a
'career' will seem a mere artificiality that has
nothing to do with what is best and sweetest
in life."</p>

<p>The words had passed her by as an idle
phrase, evoked from disappointment. And she
and Richard Allen had parted, he going to his
post on the line in Arizona, and she to Italy to
study. And yet nothing passes from us entirely.
Here, without warning, without her
intention, the little scene came up before her
eyes; and she saw again the apple-orchard in
blossom, the red brick chimney of the school-house
across the way looming up in the moonlight,
the hills in the distance, the strong,
proudly-carried figure at her side. And then
scene after scene came up before her, always
with the two figures present: the manly, devoted
lover, the self-absorbed girl.</p>

<p>Yet she had lived for ambition, and the world
had been kind to her, after she had proven her
mettle. She had not lacked lovers, but she had
never loved. Her strong will, which had determinedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
mapped out an existence entirely
free from sentiment, had carried her through
every affair triumphantly and untouched. Four
or five hours ago she had entered that car as
"free from the trammels of passion" as a vestal
virgin. What was in the air, what was in the
night, that hurried her on into imaginative
flights? Constantly, like two stars, two meaning
eyes seemed to gleam upon her, and kindle
a world of emotion latent and unsuspected in
her nature! She tried to be cynical, to laugh,
to think of something else; she tried her best
to get to sleep, but only her will could sleep,
and fancy still rioted. Richard Allen had had
the making of a fine man in him: what had
become of him,&mdash;why had nothing been heard
of him? The woman whose religion was success
had little patience with patience; it seemed
to her that all virtue was embodied in some
sort of action. A man who at forty&mdash;he must
be forty&mdash;was still obscure, was not worth a
thought. And yet he had possessed a certain
sort of strength. She had been forced to admire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
in old times, a suggested moral superiority,
a higher point of view than she considered
practical. If he had brought himself to
live up to his own standard, he must have been
unable to make necessary concessions. And
then, as Margaret recalled some "concessions"
she had herself made to success, she felt her
cheeks burn in the darkness. How often she
had traded upon her own attractions, how often
made use of the influence of her personality to
bring about certain ends! If she had not lied
in words, she had in act. Her present status
had not been attained without some sacrifice
of scruples.</p>

<p>The woman turned restlessly in her berth,
wondering why such ideas should come to her
now to interfere with her peace. She was
good; she was ashamed of nothing in her past;
she was living a high, free, independent life,
the life for a woman of intellect and energy to
lead. Thank heaven, she was not an emotional
creature! Sentiment had been trained out of
her. Long after midnight she lost consciousness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
and passed a few hours in fitful slumber.
It was cruel that she should have to dream of
Richard Allen; dream that they were together
in an open boat, drifting out to sea, and that
his arms were around her, his eyes looking into
hers. And she cared for nothing, thought of
nothing but that he held her close&mdash;how
strangely sweet it was!&mdash;</p>

<p>A jar, a shock, a sudden stop, as if the train
had run against a wall of rock, and Margaret
started up and drew the curtain aside instinctively.
A fall through space&mdash;what was it, oh,
where was she! Had the train fallen down an
embankment?</p>

<p>After a minute she realized that she had been
thrown from her berth across the car, that
other persons lay about, some groaning, some
hastily picking themselves up. She shut her
eyes: there was a sharp pain in her left arm,
and a weight upon her side. A falling lamp
had struck her, and from some cause she could
not rise; her leg must be broken. There was
a terrible confusion, much talking, and half-a-dozen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
people bending over her pityingly and
asking her questions.</p>

<p>"What has happened? Is anybody killed?"
she asked.</p>

<p>Several persons answered at once. They
had run into a freight. The engineer on their
own train was killed; no one else. Many were
hurt. Could she bear to be moved?</p>

<p>"I must," she returned, setting her lips, for
agonizing pains began to shoot through her
foot, and the thought of being touched was
suffering.</p>

<p>"Fortunately we are just on the outskirts of
Frithville&mdash;there are houses near." It was the
conductor who spoke now, and he at once took
charge. She was lifted carefully, wrapped in
blankets and carried out. Their car had sustained
less damage than any other, being in the
rear, and there was no difficulty in getting out.</p>

<p>"If she could stand it to be taken over yonder,"
said some one, pointing to a house some
distance away, "she'd be more comfortable, I
reckon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are we?" asked Margaret, bravely
suppressing her pain.</p>

<p>"Somewhere in southern Indiana&mdash;a little
town called Frithville," a man answered her.</p>

<p>"If she could stand it to be taken over to
the doctor's house&mdash;" said the persistent first
speaker.</p>

<p>"I can stand it," she interposed; "take me
there quickly."</p>

<p>They improvised a sort of rough litter of
mattresses, and carried her across a field in the
open country. The dawn was just breaking,
and the pale moon was slowly fading out of
view before the great coming light. The air
was clear, cold, crisp; and, though there had
evidently been a heavy storm during the night,
it had cleared completely, and the first ray of
sunlight glittered upon banks of frozen snow.
The house before which they stopped was a
plain, two-storied wooden structure, which
seemed at first sight peculiarly barren-looking.
Clean white curtains hung in straight, scant
folds at the windows. The door had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
drab in color, but the paint had been so assiduously
scrubbed that one now took its presence
on trust. There was a brass knocker and a
rush door-mat, on which lay a large black cat
with bristling white whiskers.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a severe Swedish
girl, whose starched cap and apron suggested
careful housekeeping, as her suspicious countenance
suggested inhospitality. She made no
objections to admitting them, however, and
Margaret was carefully deposited upon a couch
in the sitting-room to wait the coming of the
doctor, who, the maid said, had just left the
house to go to the scene of the wreck.</p>

<p>"We'll send him back to you, ma'am, right
off," one of the men assured her. "You ought
to be 'tended to first."</p>

<p>"Not if others are suffering and need him
more," said Margaret faintly.</p>

<p>The ungenial looking Swede proved herself
to be not deficient in skill, even though sympathy
was in a measure lacking. She made
her guest as comfortable as she could. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
shoe was cut from the swollen ankle, which was
bathed and bandaged, and the hurts upon the
shoulder and side were pronounced to be only
bruises which "Herr doctor would make-right."
And then Margaret was left to herself
while the girl went to make the inevitable
"cup of tea," which was to set everything
straight.</p>

<p>At first she lay perfectly still, seeing nothing,
and caring for nothing, her mind full of vexation
and impatience over an accident which
must delay the fulfilment of her engagement.
It did not occur to her that it might have been
worse; anything was bad enough.</p>

<p>After awhile her eyes began to wander idly
around the room. It seemed half parlor, half
study. Folding doors divided it from the
office at the back. There was a book-case,
well filled; some good engravings on the walls;
a few easy-chairs covered with raw silk of a dull
hue, much worn; and a writing-table between
the windows, half covered with books and
magazines. There was something agreeable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
her taste in the air of the room. She could
imagine it the abode of a man whose very
poverty could never become squalid. The
great open Franklin stove shone brightly, and
the hearth was scrupulously clean. Upon the
mantel were a bronze clock and a pair of fine
vases, dainty in tone and finish; they were the
sole womanly touches about the place. Noting
these details half indifferently, she lay back
again and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>When she opened them again, they happened
to glance directly over to a corner of the room
which had before been dim, but was now illuminated
by a shaft of sunlight. A carved
bracket hung there, and on the shelf lay a singular
looking little instrument, shaped like a
dagger, of Moorish device, the handle inlaid
with gold, left rough and unpolished. When
Margaret saw this small object, she gave a little
cry and tried to rise, but finding that impossible,
she dropped back upon her pillows as if
she had been shot, her eyes fixed upon the
little instrument with a look of recognition that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
was half pleasure, half alarm. What strange
trick was fate about to play her? How could
this thing be possible?</p>

<p>There was a noise: the front door opened,
and some one came along the hall with a firm,
measured step. Margaret's heart, that well-regulated
organ, beat to suffocation. She hardly
dared listen or look. She threw her arm up
over her forehead, nearly concealing her face.
Some one entered the room and paused beside
her. A well-remembered voice, graver, deeper
than of yore, yet with a cheery ring in it, said,
"Let me see what I can do to help you,
madam." A chair was drawn up to the side
of the couch, a gentle hand took her own. Her
pulse was beating furiously; the hand was held
rather long, as if something perplexed him.
She felt searching eyes bent upon her face, and
suddenly threw down her arm. The doctor
drew back, his face paling, and the two looked
at each other for a minute in silence. She spoke
first, putting out her hand timidly.</p>

<p>"Richard, don't you remember me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>"Remember you? As if I were likely ever
to forget you."</p>

<p>She softly touched his empty left sleeve,
pinned over his breast, two tears standing in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"At Black Gulch," he said. "I have got
over minding it. Don't grieve."</p>

<p>"You left the army?"</p>

<p>"Yes, four years ago. My health gave way.
I studied medicine in Indianapolis, was invited
here by an old friend to become his assistant,
and shortly afterward he died. That is all."</p>

<p>"You never&mdash;never&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; I married."</p>

<p>The words were an unexpected stab. Margaret
gasped, amazed that she should care.
Her face suddenly became suffused with color,
and she turned it away.</p>

<p>"She only lived a year&mdash;Margaret," said the
doctor, bending down to study the fair, flushed
face, suddenly pain-smitten.</p>

<p>"My ankle!" said Margaret faintly, drawing
his attention to the lesser hurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>He was the doctor again at once, and, for
the next half hour all professional gravity, and
as impersonal as the sphinx; yet the woman
felt through every nerve, like a musical vibration,
the thrill of his firm, warm fingers, the
scrutiny of his eyes. He was changed, worn
through suffering rather than years, his face
lined, his hair grown gray; with nothing young
about him but his eyes, which sparkled with a
cheer and brightness no grief could dim, for
they mirrored a mind above all personal considerations,
concerned with those large, loving
interests belonging to humanity.</p>

<p>The woman felt the presence of this spirit,
as if something beautiful and good had settled
softly down beside her, and mutely besought
her attention from herself and her narrow
world. She struggled against it, yet it was like
a shaft of genial sun heat, entering suddenly
some frozen glen; she felt, in a heart purposely
hardened against such influences, a stir, a thaw;
ice was breaking, and the long-stilled waters of
human affection began to flow in gentle currents,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
inspiring a sensation of delight that astonished
and abashed her.</p>

<p>The doctor came and went quietly, her eyes
following him. When he intercepted the look,
she blushed like a schoolgirl. Too busy all
that day to give her more than necessary attention,
he yet lost nothing that passed and
she had a sense which was oddly pleasant that
he understood something of what was passing
in her mind. It was terrible, too. There were
moments when she wished herself miles away.
Besides all the physical pain which she endured
that long day, Margaret's soul was the battle-ground
of a struggle far more exhausting. Ambition,
pride, and love of the world fought hard
against a tender, newly-born impulse, which it
seemed that a single breath of reason ought to
chill to death.</p>

<p>The coals burned red in the open stove; a
little tea-table was set in the middle of the
room, and in the easiest chair in the house,
piled with all the available cushions, the doctor
placed Margaret, taking his position opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
her. The solemn Swedish girl brought in
supper, which was well cooked and served with
a scrupulous cleanliness that almost atoned for
the absence of a more dainty service.</p>

<p>The doctor's face shone with satisfaction, but
his manner, although genial, was ceremonious.
Margaret felt that, in the few feet intervening
between them, there lay years of care and grief
and disappointment. She felt a yearning to
bridge the chasm, to draw nearer to him, even
though she herself had to take the hard steps
toward understanding.</p>

<p>Thought the woman: "Does he love me
still?" And thought the man: "Is she tired
of the world, and could she learn to love me
now?"</p>

<p>But they spoke of music; of camp-life on the
western frontier; of what they had seen, what
they had read. Not a word of what they felt.
A few hours later the doctor stood in his bare
little soldier's bedroom, and looked in his
glass. For five minutes he studied himself, and
then he turned away, resolved to let no new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
hope spring up in his heart. But Margaret
slept to dream of him, woke through the night
thinking of him, as she could not have thought
in the old days, when he wooed her in the confidence
of his fresh, hopeful youth.</p>

<p>There was no hotel in the village, and the
few scattered houses were crowded with the
wounded passengers, lying over till well enough
to proceed with their journey. Margaret was
not sorry that there was no other place for her
than the refuge she had been taken to. "I am
thinking that I am singularly fortunate in being
in the doctor's house, where I get special attention,"
she said to him, with a little fluttering
smile.</p>

<p>In time these shy looks wrought upon the
doctor, and his stern resolution wavered. He
found himself sounding her preferences and
attachments, with the unconfessed design of extracting
some unguarded word that might indicate
a change in her old convictions. Carrying
on together these two processes&mdash;determination
to refrain and resolution to pursue,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
which often accompanies some course of action
embraced in accordance with a natural, unworldly
judgment, he managed to betray to
the eager girl all he wished to conceal and she
wished to know. She had telegraphed to Baltimore
that she would be there in ten days.
Four of them had passed, and she was free from
pain and able to put her foot to the ground.
The doctor persisted in helping her from her
couch to the chair and back again.</p>

<p>"But I can walk alone now," she objected.</p>

<p>"We must be careful. Not until to-morrow."
She protested with greater earnestness. "True&mdash;I
have but one arm," he said, with the first
accent of bitterness she had heard from him.
Her lips parted to give utterance to a sudden
rush of words, but she only looked at him, with
eyes so eloquent that he answered the look.</p>

<p>"Margaret, do you care? Dear, I have always
loved you, I love you now,&mdash;can you
care?"</p>

<p>She drooped her head on his shoulder, but
said nothing. The doctor held her close for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
minute, and then, leaving her, began to walk
up and down the room.</p>

<p>"It is impossible!"</p>

<p>"It may be impossible," murmured Margaret
with a little blush, "but&mdash;it is true."</p>

<p>"It is cruel of me to ask it, dear. You are
young, beautiful, brilliant&mdash;with success at your
feet, and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She put up her hand imploringly. It was
caught and held. "And I am poor, obscure
and&mdash;old," he finished, his eyes upon her
face.</p>

<p>"I have come to you, Richard. It seemed
strange to me. I cannot explain it, but it
seems as if everything the world has to offer
me is nothing beside&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beside my love?" he bent on one knee beside
her chair and put her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>"I want to share your life," she said, and a
new expression grew upon her face, a high, devoted
look which was half heroic, all womanly.
"I want to learn something of the great things,
the true things."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have had greater things than I
can give you. Think of all you are leaving!"</p>

<p>She made a gesture of renunciation. "It
does not seem much to leave&mdash;for you."</p>

<p>"Ah, my darling, I am afraid you will regret
it. The work-a-day world will be a trial to
you. And mine is a veritable work-a-day
world."</p>

<p>He kept his eyes on her face, half dreading
to see her shrink away. But what woman is
not won by an appearance of self-renunciation?
Richard could not have let her go now; at the
last instant he would have snatched her to his
breast, had she drawn away. But the misgiving
that rushed over him so fiercely was a real
one, a sensible one; he felt it profoundly, and
tried to read in her eyes a shadow of this coming
regret. But her eyes were clear, loving, radiant.
She pressed herself against his breast, and gave
him the great gift of her life and her future.
Would the shadow ever come?</p>

<p>The moon looked softly in, an hour later, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
finding the lovers in that delicious dream which
once in a lifetime comes to most men and
women, drew over her face a gray cloud-veil
and left them to dream on.</p>

<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> bright day in early spring, when the
children had begun to hunt in the woods for
trailing arbutus, and the Shenandoah River reflected
in its clear depths the outlines of the
overlooking mountains, a small, straight figure,
sensibly habited in a short gray gown, made its
way along the single paved street of Bloomdale
to the principal store.</p>

<p>Young Heaton Smith, the handsome, blue-eyed
son of the proprietor, came forward with
a smiling welcome. After a few minutes' preliminary
talk, Miss Phillida confessed that she
had some notion of buying a dress.</p>

<p>He placed a stool in front of the counter extending
along that side of the store which was
devoted to dry goods, and, with the air of one</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>
<p>who affords a pleasant surprise, laid before her
several rolls of sheer, silky stuff in dainty colorings;
the most conspicuous being that which
bore bunches of deep pink rosebuds on a light
brown ground.</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" murmured Miss Phillida, taking
hold of the edge with a delicate, blue-veined
hand covered with a network of fine wrinkles.
"How Sister Emma would love this pattern!"</p>

<p>"Here's a blue," said Heaton, laying another
before her. "Handsome, aren't they? They
come ten yards to a piece; just enough for a
dress. We only got 'em in yesterday."</p>

<p>"I am mightily taken with this pink, Heaton.
But I reckon it's too young-looking for me."</p>

<p>"You don't think yourself old, ma'am?
Mother was saying, only the other day, that
none of the girls could beat you for complexion."</p>

<p>"Just hear the boy! If it was Sister Emma,
you might talk so. I do agree with anybody
that calls her a beauty. But I reckon you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
don't recollect Sister Emma, Heaton? You
was a child when she went away."</p>

<p>"I recollect her, though. It's about ten
years now, ain't it? I was twelve then. I
know I haven't forgot that big wedding-cake
with the twelve dozen eggs in it."</p>

<p>"Really, Heaton?" said Miss Phillida, coloring
with pleasure. "I was rather proud of
that cake. Emma could make nice cake herself.
I suppose she's had a chance to forget it.
Her time's taken up other ways. Denver's
quite a gay place, she says; and of course her
husband's position requires her to go out a
great deal."</p>

<p>This was uttered in a tone of proud satisfaction.
Everybody in Bloomdale knew what a
comfort it was to the solitary woman to talk
about her sister. The Virginia beauty had
married a western millionaire, and when at the
monthly sewing society Miss Phillida read aloud
her last Denver letter, these staid, but pleasure-loving
Virginia matrons listened eagerly.</p>

<p>Young Heaton leaned back against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
shelves in an easy, conversational attitude, and
looked politely interested.</p>

<p>"Of course you know she's coming home to
make a visit, Heaton?" The little lady's joy
and yearning brimmed over her mild blue eyes,
and she lowered her head, pretending to examine
the goods.</p>

<p>"So I heard," said Heaton cordially. "We'll
all enjoy seeing her, I'm shore."</p>

<p>"I expect her to-morrow," Miss Phillida cried
excitedly. "By the morning train."</p>

<p>A vehicle drew up before the long porch,
and the little woman endeavored to seem occupied
with her purchase.</p>

<p>"I reckon this black and white'd be more
appropriate to my years," she said in a critical
tone. "But somehow I'm awfully in the notion
of taking that pink."</p>

<p>"Take the pink, Miss Phillidy; and if you
change your mind, we'll take it back and give
you another in the place of it."</p>

<p>Miss Phillida cast another glance at the black
and white, then turned again to the pink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll take it then, Heaton. I feel somehow
as if it'd please Emma to have me get a gown
that looked cheerful. And I must be getting
young again, for I haven't been so in the notion
of dressing up for ages. But, dear me! if I
haven't forgot to ask the price! Maybe it's
beyond my reach."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, Miss Phillidy, it's a bargain.
Five dollars for any pattern. A chance we
mayn't be able to offer our customers again."</p>

<p>It was a considerable sum for Miss Phillida
to give for a spring dress. She was deep in
calculations when a handsome ruddy man of
about forty-five entered the store, and greeted
her with delightful heartiness.</p>

<p>He called her "Cousin Phillidy," and the
cousinship, although very distant, enabled him
to do the little woman many a good turn. In
his heart, Mr. Ned Miller always looked upon
her as the woman who might, but for a chance,
have been his sister-in-law. The chance had
been Emma Wood's marriage with another
man. But that was not his fault. Bloomdale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
said that Ned Miller was of too affectionate a
nature to stay a widower.</p>

<p>As she reflected his sunshiny smile and answered
his gay badinage, a strange idea suddenly
entered Miss Phillida's head. It made
her get up in great haste.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'll take the pink, Heaton," she said
quickly. "I'll carry it right with me."</p>

<p>"My horses air at the door, cousin. Let me
drive you up the street."</p>

<p>"It's but a step; I'm obliged to you, Cousin
Ned. And it's such a sweet day, I like to
walk."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll see you at preaching Sunday,
cousin. And your sister, too, I hope. But if
I'm in town before, I'll just call in&mdash;to see if I
can be of any service."</p>

<p>"Thank you," murmured Miss Phillida.
"Give my love to all at Maplegrove," and she
hastened homeward, amazed at herself, and inclined
to believe that the Father of Evil had
put that startling notion into her head.</p>

<p>She stopped at the gate of a low, brown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
house opposite the Methodist Church, and,
going through a garden crowded with sweet,
old-fashioned flowers, opened the side door
into a little entry about six feet square, from
which one door on the left led to the sitting-room,
and another on the right into a spare
bedroom. The kitchen lay beyond the sitting
room, and thither Miss Phillida directed her
steps. A cup of tea, taken upon the spotless
pine table, brought her back to herself. She
had spread out the dress pattern over the back
of the settee, to look at while she ate her
dinner; and after washing up the dishes, she
opened a door leading into a chilly bedroom,
all dark, rich old mahogany and white draperies,
and carefully laid it away in the lower drawer
of a capacious bureau.</p>

<p>"I reckon it was extravagant of me," she
soliloquized. "But I couldn't shame Emma
by appearing out in company with her in old
duds."</p>

<p>Emma arrived the next morning. Bloomdale
was looking for her when the train
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
stopped at the dilapidated old shed called a
"deep-ho." At first Bloomdale thought itself
disappointed. It had expected a brilliant
young lady accompanied by a quantity of baggage,
exhibiting, perhaps, some of the haughtiness
of a person used to the homage paid to
rank and wealth. Instead, there was left upon
the platform, besides a small, plain trunk, a tall
woman dressed all in black, her face covered
with a heavy veil. She advanced hesitatingly.
Miss Phillida, straining her eyes to see through
that veil, suddenly pressed forward and fell into
her arms.</p>

<p>"It's you, sister! I know you by your walk.
Come and get into the carryall, there's room
for the trunk at the back."</p>

<p>Bewildered, but energetic, she steered her
sister past the little crowd and landed her
safely in the old carryall, upon the back of
which a strapping negro was already adjusting
the trunk. Miss Phillida recognized him as
the coachman of Mr. Ned Miller, and the tears
came to her eyes as he handed her the reins.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
To her excited sense, it seemed significant that
the first person to show kindness to Emma on
her home-coming should be some one belonging
to her old lover.</p>

<p>She talked without knowing what she said.
So far, Emma had not spoken, after the first
low murmur of greeting. Emma!&mdash;the gay,
sparkling girl whose high spirits and talent for
conversation had made her a favorite in county
society. For whom could she be in mourning?
Miss Phillida racked her brain with conjectures.</p>

<p>When they were inside the house Emma
lifted her veil, gazing around like one who had
just returned to life from a long trance. Her
face, whose beauty was of a grand type, softened
and brightened from its look of stern repose,
as one by one she recognized objects
once loved and familiar.</p>

<p>"Everything is just the same," she said in a
low voice, vibrant with feeling. "Grandfather's
and father's swords there on the wall, the fox-skin
rugs, the horse-hair armchairs, and the dear
old brass andirons!&mdash;How good of you to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
a fire, Phillida, dear! It looks so cheerful. I
haven't seen a wood fire on the hearth since I
left home."</p>

<p>"You mean home in Denver?" palpitated
Miss Phillida, feeling strangely awed by this
sister with grave manner and pale face.</p>

<p>"No!" The denial was quick and passionate,
more like the fervor of the old Emma.
She threw off her bonnet and cloak with rapid
movements, and held out her arms to little Miss
Phillida. In a moment all constraint had
melted away between the long-severed sisters.
The tongue of the elder was loosened, and she
asked question after question, which, however,
Emma parried.</p>

<p>"I have a long story to tell you, dear; but
let us wait till evening. When the curtains are
drawn and the lamps lit, I shall feel better able
to talk. Let me just enjoy being at home, for
a little while."</p>

<p>She followed Miss Phillida out to the kitchen
and, sitting on a low chair with the big black
cat purring in her lap, watched her fry the

chicken and bake the corn cakes for dinner,
talking meanwhile, fluently and entertainingly,
of life in the West, and of the different cities
she had visited. But not a word of herself.</p>

<p>When dinner was over, she insisted upon
wiping the dishes; and it was then that Miss
Phillida scrutinized her dress, and saw that it
was rusty, and not of fine material.</p>

<p>"Oh, just a traveling dress," thought the
elder sister, who experienced an odd fluttering
of the heart.</p>

<p>The afternoon was consumed in examining
the house and garden. Miss Phillida raised her
own vegetables, and kept a few chickens, which
latter amused themselves by scratching up her
seeds and pecking her choicest tomatoes as they
ripened. A creek watered the lower end of the
garden, and here a half-dozen ducks disported
lazily. Under a spreading apple tree was a
bench covered with an old buffalo robe, upon
which she sat with her sewing on summer afternoons.
Surrounded thus by comfort and peace,
the gentle spinster had lived her harmless existence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
conscious of but one ungratified wish:
the longing for her sister. And now that wish
was accomplished. With tremors of delight she
displayed everything, confiding all her little
plans to affectionate, sympathetic ears. Each
homely detail gave Emma fresh pleasure. She
seemed to desire to penetrate to the heart of
this simple home life; to attach herself to it,
like one who thirsted for an intimacy with
something genuine and natural.</p>

<p>Miss Phillida saw with pleasure that clouds
were gathering, and that darkness would come
on earlier than usual. Emma became grave
again after supper; and when she seated herself
in the big rocking-chair before the hearth in
the sitting-room, the firelight played over features
that wore an expression of noble sadness.</p>

<p>"It is three years since I left Denver," she
said, turning her luminous gray eyes upon her
sister's bewildered countenance. "I sent my
letters to a friend there who mailed them
to you. It was not necessary for you to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
harassed by a knowledge of my sufferings. You
fancied I was living a happy, care-free life with
a rich and generous husband. Heavens!&mdash;How
unsophisticated we are, we country folks in
Virginia!</p>

<p>"I can't make it all plain to you, Phillida,
for you wouldn't understand without having
gone through it, how, little by little, I learned
the ways of society, and on what a base foundation
the wealth we enjoyed was built. Robert
was a speculator, and a reckless, unscrupulous
one. And besides this he was not honest
in small things. The husband I had imagined
a fairy prince, full of noble qualities, was not
only false but mean. He gave me whatever
was necessary to make a show; nothing for my
pleasure. Poor little sister! Don't you suppose
I wanted to send you presents? I never
had a dollar of my own all those seven years.
But finally the end came. Robert failed&mdash;and
it was a dishonorable failure. He went away
in the night, leaving me to bear the brunt of
everything."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" breathed Miss Phillida. "And
didn't he come back?"</p>

<p>"He wrote me a letter from Canada, telling
me to come over to him, for he was sick. Well,
I went! I nursed him, and worked for him,&mdash;and
I put up for two years with a life that was
Purgatory. You mustn't expect me to be very
sorry he died then, Phillida. You wouldn't if
you knew all. I did hate to come back to
you,&mdash;such a failure! But it was a miserable
existence all alone there, in Quebec, and&mdash;I
knew you would be glad to see me, dear!"</p>

<p>For a few moments the sisters wept together.
Then Emma raised her head.</p>

<p>"I thought that perhaps I might get a
school. Of course I intend to do something."</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried Miss Phillida, wiping her
eyes and taking her sister's hand. "You
needn't do that, dearest. With the garden and
the cow and chickens, there is plenty. And
then, you know, the hundred a year that comes
from the railroad shares is as much yours as
mine. Everything is yours, and, thank heaven,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
you're at home now, where everybody'll be
good to you!"</p>

<p>"The same generous, self-sacrificing little
soul! But, dear Phillida, I must work, if only
to keep myself happy. I should soon be miserable
and restless with nothing to do. Come,
make up your mind to let me be a help instead
of a burden. I have set my heart upon the
school. Tell me, who are the trustees now?"</p>

<p>"Cousin Ned Miller's a trustee," replied Miss
Phillida, who had grown thoughtful. "Perhaps
you're right, Emma. Maybe you'll be
happier with the children to think about. And
he'll get you a school, I'm quite sure."</p>

<p>Emma rocked softly back and forth, looking
into the fire. Perhaps she saw visions there of
a new and happier life, for her face took on an
expression of content.</p>

<p>But some little personal worry preyed upon
Miss Phillida's mind. She said nothing about
it, but one morning when Emma had gone for
a drive with one of the neighbors, she took
from the bureau drawer the precious parcel reposing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
there, and with an air of guilt made her
way to the store.</p>

<p>"I've brought back this dress," she said confidentially
to Heaton. "And if you'll be so kind
as to change it, I'll take the black and white
piece. I feel it's more suitable, somehow."</p>

<p>He readily obliged her, and the new pattern
was deposited in the deep drawer, after which
the little woman wore an air of chastened
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Cousin Ned Miller justified Miss Phillida's
confidence. He not only promised Emma the
school, but offered to get a class in French for
her; and he spent time running about, waiting
on her, and cheering her in every way that
could suggest itself to his kind heart. His
handsome team stood almost every day before
the little brown house, while he loitered on the
honeysuckle scented porch with the sisters.
There was always some plausible excuse for his
coming, and the true meaning of his visits did
not dawn upon Miss Phillida's mind until one
afternoon when she suddenly entered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
sitting-room and saw them on the sofa together.</p>

<p>The little woman's face was aflame with joyous
excitement, as she ran into the kitchen and
began moving things about, without knowing
or caring what she did. The happiest outcome!&mdash;the
most natural, the most comfortable,
and most reasonable arrangement that
could happen! Emma and Cousin Ned!
They were made for each other.</p>

<p>"I really can't keep still," thought Miss
Phillida. "I must go somewhere."</p>

<p>As she put on her old gray gown, a thought
suddenly flashed into her mind. "Maybe it'll
look curious," she reflected. "But I declare if
I won't."</p>

<p>Once more she entered the store with a parcel
under her cape. Fortunately the accommodating
clerk was the only one around.</p>

<p>Miss Phillida blushed as she laid the black
and white dress pattern on the counter.</p>

<p>"I'm ashamed to be so changeable, Heaton,
indeed I am; but things have altered lately, and&mdash;my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
mind's more given to bright colors, somehow.
So, if it won't inconvenience you any,
and if you'd really just as lief&mdash;I think I'll
change back to the pink."</p>

MRS. MAY'S PRIVATE INCOME.</a><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Laura McHenry quietly turned her
back upon the wealthy and desirable suitor her
family had decided she should marry, and gave
her hand to William May, a middle-aged lawyer
of no particular standing or prospects, everybody
decided that she had thrown herself
away.</p>

<p>Mr. May began his married life upon a wind-fall
of fifteen hundred dollars, his largest fee in
a dozen years. A pretty house in Richmond was
leased for a year, and the delightful experience
of buying new furniture and disposing it to the
best advantage gave the young wife such happy
occupation for the first two months that she
was always in a sunny humor, full of brightness
and variability, and that kind of independent
submissiveness which charms a man who likes</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>
<p>to see a woman much occupied with household
affairs, and with himself, as the center of the
household. Her pretty show of activity amused
him. He said she made occupation for herself
in moving the furniture from one place to another
and then back again. One of his jokes
was to ask her where he should find the bed
when he came home. And upon this she would
pretend to pout, and then they would kiss each
other without the least awkwardness or shame-facedness,
and he would go off to his work
with a pleasant sense of security in the devotion
of his lovely wife, while she would carry in her
mind all day long the picture of his smiling
face, and love him for every pretty speech and
admiring look.</p>

<p>They were really happy. And it lasted quite
six months, till all the fifteen hundred dollars
had been drawn out of the bank, except the
bare moiety necessary to keep the account.</p>

<p>When Dinah's wages were a month over-due,
her substantial presence disappeared out
of the kitchen, and Laura's dainty white hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
made acquaintance with dish-mops, stove-lifters
and brooms. Such an ignoramus as she
found herself! And with what zeal she bent
her mind to the study of cookery books and
the household corners of the newspapers. And
brains told. She left the flour out of her first
cake, but her second one was a triumph of art,
and muffins, veal cutlets and custards came out
from under her clever fingers with a delicacy
and deftness that surprised herself and gratified
May immensely. Although he was sorry to
have her work in the kitchen, and sorry to find
her now too tired to sing to him in the evenings
with the same spirit and freshness that
used to breathe through her songs. But the
worst thing was that fatigue and unending attention
to details, united to those perpetual
interruptions from the door-bell which drive
busy women almost distracted, had their effect
upon Laura's delicate frame. She grew "nervous,"
which is often a misnomer for combined
worry and distasteful labors. It will
seem to the inexperienced that the housekeeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
for two people, in a convenient little house,
should have been a mere bagatelle to a clever
woman. Perhaps it would have been if Laura
had not had her profession to learn as well as
practise. She had not been brought up to
housework, but to sing. Music had always
been so much a part of her life that she no
more thought of giving up her daily study
hours than she would have thought of giving
up her William. It was not that she chose to
work at her piano three or four hours a day
after her morning housework was done, but
that it simply did not occur to her to do otherwise.
She usually forgot or neglected to take
any lunch, and by dinner time had no appetite,
which had its conveniences, for it was rapidly
coming to pass that the dinners she could compass
upon the scanty and irregular supplies
of money she received were scarcely sufficient
for more than one person, and she contrived
that her husband should be that
person.</p>

<p>She had a thousand devices for inducing him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
to eat the bit of steak, the single cup-custard,
or the slice of fish. He was far from realizing
that his delicately fair wife, with her dainty
tastes, was illy nourished upon the tea and
toast to which she often confined herself. Nor
did Laura realize it.</p>

<p>But after all, it was not the housework, the
scanty food, nor even the lack of variety and
refreshment in her life that was beginning to
tell heavily upon her health, that was spoiling
her beautiful disposition and making her apprehensive
and irritable. It was something
more terrible to a loving woman, honoring and
admiring her husband with all her soul, than
all these things combined.</p>

<p>The third anniversary of their wedding-day
came. Laura remembered what day it was as
she opened her eyes in the early dawn. A
sigh escaped her before she knew it. The
tendency to meditate, as Nathaniel Hawthorne
observed, makes a woman sad. Laura had
always been thoughtful; lately&mdash;being much
alone and having some matters to think about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
not tending to raise her spirits, she had insensibly
become sober.</p>

<p>She put her feet out of bed into a pair of
worn slippers, and shaking down a heavy mass
of dark brown hair that matched her eyes in
color, made her toilet without waking her
husband, who slumbered serenely till within ten
minutes of the breakfast hour, when she called
him, meeting with a not overgracious response.</p>

<p>The little dining-room had a pleasant and
comfortable air this chilly September morning.
The little round table bore a glass containing a
sprig or two of red geranium from the pot in
the window, and the coffee-urn of nickel was
polished till it shone like silver.</p>

<p>Mr. May came in after keeping her waiting
fifteen minutes, and after helping her and himself
to oatmeal, began to read the newspaper
that lay at his plate in apparent forgetfulness
of everything else. He was a stout, rather
short man, with large, luminous brown eyes
that never seemed to be looking at anything in
particular. A full beard and mustache sprinkled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
with gray hid a mouth that in his youth
had made the lower part of his face strongly
resemble that of Peter the Great. There was
some quality about him that caused one to
dread arousing his anger; a strong sense of his
own importance, perhaps. Some persons have
the gift of reflecting their own egotism into
the minds of others, rendering themselves
formidable entirely through an appeal to the
imagination.</p>

<p>Laura was a tall, gracefully-formed woman,
with a presence that promised to become majestic
with increasing years. Yet at heart she
was timid and sensitive as a delicate child, needing
affection and encouragement in the same
measure; the last woman in the world for a
man who lived entirely within himself, and to
whom a wife was an adjunct, to be put on and
off at his pleasure. Yet May had in regard to
her&mdash;and in regard to all other things&mdash;a conscience
void of offense. He took credit to
himself for having given her her heart's desire
in his love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>The door-bell jangled sharply. May looked
up.</p>

<p>"If that is the landlord," he said impressively,
"I don't want to see him."</p>

<p>"What shall I tell him?" asked Laura.</p>

<p>"Tell him anything you please!" The tone
was sternly impatient this time.</p>

<p>She went slowly into the narrow hall, and
after a momentary parley with some one who
spoke in a high, angry voice, returned with a
bill which she laid before him without a word.</p>

<p>"Tell him I will&mdash;attend to it."</p>

<p>"He says&mdash;&mdash;" she murmured deprecatingly,
but got no further; the lowering expression
that came over his face was too lacerating to
her feelings. She preferred confronting the
irate butcher again.</p>

<p>But there was a lump in her throat as she
quietly resumed her seat. One of her ideas of
the "protection" promised by the marriage
ceremony had been a shielding from the roughness
of persons of this sort. Why did he ask
her to stand between him and the landlord, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
coal man and the butcher? Why, oh, why,
was there any necessity for these evasions and
subterfuges? She looked at her husband as
he arose at last, after a leisurely breakfast hour,
and stood by the window finishing a paragraph
in his paper. He was a strong, robust man in
the prime of life, with a profession and hosts
of acquaintances to help on his interests.
Why could he not at least make the small
income necessary to keep their very modest
establishment going?</p>

<p>The explanation lay in a single fact. May
was a man of visionary schemes, always chasing
some will-o'-the-wisp which promised fortune
and distinction, finding his pleasure in holding
honorary posts at his political club, which gave
him a chance to talk and repaid him in a
cheaply gained reputation for ability.</p>

<p>Little by little Laura's idealized vision of
her husband had faded before the pressure of
facts. But she clung to the shreds of her faith
as women do hold to their illusions; as they
must if the world is to go on and homes continue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
to exist. There was something still for
her to learn, however, and not the easiest lesson
that had been set for her.</p>

<p>She set rather indifferently about her practising
that afternoon. It seemed to be no matter
whether Chopin or Mendelssohn spoke to her
soul; both were alike rendered with a cold
brilliancy very far removed from her usual
sympathetic interpretation. Her thoughts
were far away, wandering amid scenes of her
girlhood; a happy time, full of social enjoyment,
of affectionate family intercourse, of
freedom from care, from make-shifts, from the
dishonor of debt; a dishonor that bore lightly
upon May, with his belief in the future, but
that was crushing to her sensitive nature. Idly
her fingers wandered, swifter her thoughts flew,
till all at once a sentence of homely wisdom
from a modern novelist came into her mind:
"Many women are struggling under the burden
of money-saving when they had far rather
spend their energies in money-getting."</p>

<p>She arose impetuously, her eyes suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
full of light. What had she been thinking of?
There was a fund of unused wealth in her fine
musical education, in her beautiful voice, a
little impaired by hardships, but magnificent
still. Here was the way out of all this mirage
of poverty; with what she could earn by taking
a class in Madame Cable's school combined
with her husband's earnings, they could live
with comparative ease and comfort. Oh,
happiness, oh, relief! Laura's hat and cape
were on in ten minutes and a car was taking
her down-town to the dwelling of her old
teacher, sure of a welcome and of aid. Madame
had offered her this position five years ago,
just after her graduation, but her mother would
not hear of it. Now her mother was two
thousand miles away, on a frontier post with
Major McHenry, entirely ignorant of the state
of affairs in her daughter's household.</p>

<p>What a curiously elusive thing courage is!
By the time Laura's finger was on the bell at
Madame's door, her breath was coming in
gasps, and while she waited in the lofty and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
handsomely furnished parlor for the coming
of her old teacher, all the strength went out
of her knees, so that she found it difficult to
rise when that stately, self-possessed woman
came in with a little silken rustle of skirts and
extended hand.</p>

<p>It is so hard to say outright to a friend,
"Help me!" And yet, is not the opportunity
of giving help and comfort one of the rewards
of a successful life? Why do we distrust
human goodness? It was the pride in Laura's
nature that made her talk of everything else
rather than the object of her call, that made
her tongue falter and her cheek grow paler,
when at length she brought herself to her task.</p>

<p>But fate was not ill-disposed. It happened
that Madame needed her services. She had
come at an opportune moment, and in a few
minutes the business was satisfactorily settled.</p>

<p>"At the same time, my dear," said Madame,
folding her soft, fat hands and shaking her
head till the emerald drops in her ears emitted
flashes of green fire, "I must say that I never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
like to see a married woman set out to earn
money. It is apt to spoil her husband. A
man should support his wife. It is his duty
and it ought to be his pleasure. And another
side of the matter is that women to whom the
extra income they can gain by their talents
means luxury and possibly extravagance, forget
that such competition makes it harder for their
needy sisters. Money-making is not such a
gracious task. It should be left to those who
really need the money."</p>

<p>"I am not going to tell you I need it,"
thought Laura. Aloud, she said with much
indifference:</p>

<p>"Madame, have you any one in your mind
you would rather get to take your classes&mdash;any
one you think would do the work better?"</p>

<p>"No," the teacher acknowledged that she
knew no other superior to her old pupil.
"To tell you the truth, if I did I should feel
it a duty to engage the better worker. The
principal of a school like this cannot let her
feelings guide her, you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then as the advantage is mutual," said
Laura, a smile breaking over her serious face,
"my conscience is at rest. It is a matter of
the success of the fittest. My needier sister
is not so well prepared for the post as I, and
so I get it."</p>

<p>"Really, you are right," murmured Madame,
with her head on one side. "But," she added
as her visitor rose, "take my advice about one
thing: keep your earnings for yourself; they
belong to you. Don't let your husband find
out that there is a&mdash;another capable bread-winner
in the house."</p>

<p>Madame had not the highest opinion in the
world of Mr. William May. But who lays to
heart words of selfish caution? Not the wife
who in the glow of comfort and peace arising
from the prospect of an income of her own,
feels all the old confidence and affection return
as she explains matters to her husband with a
careful avoidance of any wound to his self-love,
and a blissful dwelling upon the pleasure
and advantage that is to come to herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
in the healthful exercise of her accomplishments.</p>

<p>May was a little afraid their social standing
would suffer. He certainly did not like the
idea of his wife teaching in a school. It was
contrary to all his preconceptions of her domestic,
home-loving disposition.</p>

<p>"It is a reflection upon me," he said moodily,
adding with a little passionate movement that
brought her within his arm, her cheek close to
his lips: "I didn't marry you to let you work,
my darling!"</p>

<p>She might have answered that he had let
her work at harder things, but she did not.
She dwelt upon the idea of the comfort a
regular occupation was to be to her during the
long winter days. She would be much happier
and less lonely with something to do.
Very little said she of the salary that was an
item of so much importance in her mind.</p>

<p>But after he had gone out to his club she
got out a little blank book and figured it all
away for six months to come. She resolved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
to leave out of consideration the house-rent
and the table. Naturally, William would continue
to bear the burden of these responsibilities.
Her design was to fill in the vacancies
which he was indifferent to. So much for the
gas bill, so much for laundry, so much for the
seats in church. And something over for the
indispensable winter clothing and for the joy
of giving. She looked forward to the happiness
of hanging a new hat upon the rack in
place of dear Will's shabby one, and of supplying
a pair of slippers. Bliss and comfort of a
little control over circumstances, instead of
being compelled to stand helpless and anxious
waiting upon the good fortune of another!
Could a man have any idea of what this feeling
is to a woman? Mr. May could not have had,
or he would never have done what he did.</p>

<p>All that first month Laura was buoyed up
by the anticipation of that comfortable check
she was soon to finger. Cool autumn breezes
were beginning to blow, but when first one
woman, then another, put on wraps, until her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
plain undraped gown appeared odd, she merely
smiled indifferently and warmed herself with
the thought of pay-day. When the farina
kettle sprang a leak she laughingly declared
it was old enough to be superannuated. A
dollar seemed such a trifle to worry over
now.</p>

<p>At last it was in her hands. The first earning
of her life. With a child's glee she hurried
home and displayed it to her husband,
enjoying his teasing comments on her sudden
accession to wealth. But the dinner had to be
cooked, and recalling herself to this duty, she
ran into the kitchen, leaving the check behind
her on the desk.</p>

<p>"It is all right," said Mr. May, when she
looked for it later in the evening. "I put it
in my private drawer."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it is safer there," she returned
easily, and got out her mending basket, humming
a gay tune, more light of heart than she
had been in many a day.</p>

<p>The next day was Saturday, and she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
more morning work to do than usual, but she
hurried through it, and by half-past ten she
had her hat and gloves on and was rummaging
the desk for her check. It was nowhere to be
found.</p>

<p>"Impossible that it could have been stolen,"
she exclaimed. "Impossible! It was not indorsed.
No one could use it, even if a thief
had made his way in, and that is absurd to
think of. It <i>must</i> be here."</p>

<p>Only when every paper had been taken out
and scrutinized did she desist from her search,
and almost crying with vexation, resigned herself
to await her husband's return and ask his
advice.</p>

<p>"My check!" she cried breathlessly, almost
before he was fairly inside the door. "It is
gone!"</p>

<p>He turned with a somewhat puzzled expression
at her excited manner.</p>

<p>"The check? Oh, why, that is all right. I
put it in the bank this morning."</p>

<p>"You put it in the bank?" repeated Laura
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
slowly. "But how could you? It was not
indorsed."</p>

<p>"I indorsed it," he answered rather shortly,
annoyed at all this explanation about a mere
matter of course. Were not he and his wife
one, and was not everything in common between
them? It had not entered his head for
a single instant that there was anything amiss
about a procedure that was to Laura a veritable
thunderbolt.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment with her eyes lowered,
ashamed for him who thought of nothing
less than of being ashamed for himself. It
was impossible to reproach him; he was a man
whom a breath of censure hardened into rock.
While the sunshine of applause and sympathy
shone upon him he was debonair and charming,
but the first chilling breath of blame brought
all the ice in his nature to the surface. She
had experienced the change; she dared not
encounter it. Besides, it was not in this first
instant of a new revelation of his creed that
she was to feel all the sense of his moral flexibility.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
That was reserved for later, when her
keen instinct of justice and of individual rights
had been outraged again and again. She loved
him. To win a smile and a kind word from
him what would she not have sacrificed? The
mere trifle of money was nothing. It was the
feeling of having been unfairly treated, of having
been not considered at all where she had
every right to consideration. And yet the want
of that trifle of money was to make her miserable
for a long time to come.</p>

<p>It was hard to be sweet and loving all day
Sunday, with a weight of suppressed thought
upon her mind, but forbearance nourishes
affection, and by Monday she was her own
tender, submissive self again. Besides, it had
occurred to her that the money was not quite
out of her reach; William would give her a
check if she asked him for it.</p>

<p>When she made the suggestion he readily
assented, and made out one to her for five
dollars before he left Monday morning. When
she timidly broached the subject again he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
looked annoyed, and said curtly that the landlord
had the money.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" began Laura, flushing hotly,
then closed her lips and went quietly about
her work. What was there to say? The landlord
had to be paid, of course. Only somehow,
she had thought that her husband would
do that, as he had always managed it before.</p>

<p>But the following month brought Mr. May
increasing ill-luck. He would have been a
generous and kindly man if he had prospered,
and with nothing to bring it to the surface he
might have gone through life, his lack of sterling
principle unsuspected. He could be generous
but not just; he could recognize the rights
of others&mdash;the right of tradesmen to be paid,
the rights of his political comrades to a fulfilment
of his promises to them&mdash;<i>if</i> everything
went well with himself. But to tell the truth
in the teeth of disaster, to face an irate creditor,
to climb down from his height of vain ambition
and lay to heart that vow of duty his
childish lips had uttered at his mother's knee&mdash;"To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
labor truly to get my own living, and
do my duty in that state of life to which it
shall please God to call me"&mdash;this was what
William May had not it in him to perform.
And his wife, with her clear moral sense, her
unbending Puritan conscience, was doomed to
see him fail.</p>

<p>It was not the loss of her money that pained
her so much when on the next pay-day she
handed him her check in very pity and
sorrow for his "bad luck." It was the feeling
that do what she would, work as she might,
they would never be any better off. And the
still more dreary revelation that as her energy
was more feverishly applied his diminished.
The more earnest and eager she grew to pay
off their increasing debts and establish system
in their ways, the more careless he became.</p>

<p>She furbished up her wedding gown and
made engagements to sing at parlor entertainments.
She gave private lessons. And
she made money. Some of it she handled
herself, but most of it was "put in the bank,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
and drawn out for a strange purpose: one she
disapproved and disbelieved in utterly, but
could not positively oppose.</p>

<p>He was so boyishly eager about it, so confident
of his success. Through activity unprecedented
and maneuverings he did not
care to remember, Mr. May had been put up
for State senator from his district, and in all
the bustle of officering small meetings and
petty "bossing," his spirits were so high, and
he was so good-humored and affectionate that
his wife had not the heart to tell him that this
was the worst waste of time in which he had
yet engaged. For to her sane, cautious mind
it was apparent from the first that he had not
the shadow of a chance of being elected.</p>

<p>It happened that on the very eve of the
election she was engaged to sing at Carnegie
Hall. He could not possibly spare time to
take her, and she went down alone, in a car.
Her eyes were very bright and a spot of color
burned in each cheek. She was beautiful, with
the beauty of spirit that has triumphed over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
flesh. But a physician in the audience whispered
to his wife that that lovely woman was
far along in consumption. "And she will go
quick, too, poor thing!"</p>

<p>The troublesome cough which she had neglected
all winter annoyed her more than usual
going home, but she was rather shocked than
grieved when in the middle of the night a
hemorrhage came on. Life was growing hard
and duty perplexing. But sheer force of will
and affection made her seem better next day,
and she would not hear of her husband staying
with her. He was pledged to appear elsewhere
and she made him go. He did not come in
till after midnight, and then&mdash;she sat up in
sudden terror, listening to that stumbling step,
those mumbling speeches! It was not only
his election that May had lost that night; his
manhood had followed.</p>

<p>Laura turned her face to the wall. Was life
to hold this new horror? Ah, that she might
escape the next day, with its shame, its sorrow
and its pitiful regrets. But what she expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
did not come. May was constitutionally incapable
of confessing himself at fault. He
slept off his intoxication and did not get up
until he was quite himself again, cool and non-committal.</p>

<p>"Bad luck again, girlie," he said with an
assumption of indifference. "I can't make you
Mrs. Senator this time."</p>

<p>"Poor Will!" the wife murmured. "I am
sorry, dear."</p>

<p>"You are better?" he asked hastily, struck
with her expression. "You must have the
doctor."</p>

<p>It was a tardy suggestion, and Laura smiled
sadly. The doctor came, however. But all
he could do was to hold out those vague hopes
which are no comfort to anxious hearts. Before
long her mother was sent for, but the
dread disease did its rapid work. Laura's
great trial to the last was the terrible sense of
responsibility that haunted her about the expenses
that were being incurred.</p>

<p>"When I am not here, mother, what will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
he do? Poor fellow, nobody understands him
but me."</p>

<p>A little while afterwards she aroused herself
from a fit of musing and murmured:</p>

<p>"This awful feeling of helplessness!&mdash;and I
tried so hard to set things right. I thought
when I had a little income of my own that
everything would go well."</p>

<p>"You have killed yourself," said her mother,
darting a look of reproach at the unconscious
husband, who entered the room at this moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, don't say that," Laura whispered.
"I only did what I wanted to do. Will and I
have been very happy, only&mdash;&mdash;" But neither
the mother nor the husband, bending over the
bed, heard the rest of the sentence.</p>

  THE LAZIEST GIRL IN VIRGINIA.</a><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
  <a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the Virginia side of the Potomac
River, five miles across from Washington City
whose twinkling lights can be distinctly seen by
night, lies a little farm of about twenty-five acres,
owned by a widow and her three daughters,
Caroline, Minnie and Rosa.</p>

<p>The dwelling is a villa rather than a farm-house,
with wide verandas that are the favorite
sitting-rooms of the family in summer. The
glimpse they catch of the river traffic and of
the far-off city gives them a cheerful feeling of
nearness to active life, while they are removed
from its noise and crowds.</p>

<p>Besides this property Widow Jones had found
herself possessed, at her husband's death, of an
immense tract of unproductive land down on
Chesapeake Bay which could not be sold until</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>
<p>Rosa, the younger girl, now eighteen, came of
age. Meanwhile, the taxes vexed her soul.</p>

<p>Hospitable, easy-going and accustomed to
consider luxuries positive necessities, the family
would have been severely straitened if it had
not been for the nicety with which their various
talents helped one another out.</p>

<p>Caroline had excellent business ability and
managed all the outside affairs. She drew the
dividends on their railway stock, parleyed with
lawyers, and engaged and settled with the hired
men. In the burning August weather, when a
dozen red-shirted Negroes were to be cared for,
this slender young girl, in flaring straw hat and
short gingham dress, mounted her horse and
rode up and down the fields, a keen-eyed, cheery,
sweet-voiced overseer. Regardless of her own
meals she helped old black Jessie prepare the
meals for the men in the little cabin, and there
was no complaint as to quality or quantity
under her liberal rule. She did the marketing
also and bought the other supplies. Then
Mrs. Jones took up the work, and her deft fingers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
and good taste converted crude materials into
food and raiment for the quartet. She was a
notable housekeeper and the best of neighbors,
her round, jolly visage being sure to appear at
every moment of need, and her chicken broth
and jellies lingered pleasantly in the memory
of the fretful convalescent.</p>

<p>Minnie's function was the care of all the live
animals on the farm. She had unerring judgment
concerning mules and horses, understood
the peculiarities of cows, and knew everything
worth knowing about poultry and bees. She
was a plump, happy-looking blonde, with a
lovely hand, a neat foot, and a playfully witty
tongue that, like her own bees, never stung the
wise but kept fools at bay. Alert and busy
from morning till night she gave no thought to
the admirers who sighed for her smiles, but
laughingly turned them over to Rosa, who had,
she said, nothing else to do but to make herself
charming.</p>

<p>Rosa was the strongest possible contrast to
her energetic sisters. Rarely beautiful, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
gifted with an artistic faculty that nearly approached
genius, she was apparently utterly devoid
of ambition or sense of responsibility, and
was content to be waited upon and cared for
as if she was still the petted infant whose graces
had at the outset won the willing service of
every one about her.</p>

<p>Her form was of medium height, but so symmetrical
that she appeared taller than she was.
Her head was borne on her full, white throat
with a sort of dreamy grace, bent it almost
seemed by the weight of her magnificent tresses,
the color of ripe wheat when the sun is shining
upon it, and falling a quarter of a yard below
her waist. Her eyes were of a deep, dark
brown, with the softness of a Newfoundland
dog's when he is gazing wistfully at his master.
It would have been as impossible to say anything
harsh to Rosa, when she opened those
great dark eyes and looked at you, as it would
be to strike a dove or a gazelle or a sweet
young baby. Usually the heavy, blue-veined
lids half veiled them, and as her seashell cheeks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
warmed to their pinkest tone, and her exquisite
bow of a mouth fell slightly apart, as she lay,
as she loved to do, in the hammock on the west
veranda, an artist would have thought her the
very embodiment of love's young dream of
sweet, maidenly beauty.</p>

<p>She seemed all softness and gentleness. Perhaps
only her mother knew what strength of
will and temper lay behind Rosa's placid brow
and square little chin. There had been some
stout tussels between a determined little mother
and a rosebud of a baby in the years gone by;
and although the match might have seemed
an unequal one, the result had always been the
same. "A compromise," Major Jones had
laughingly called it, meaning, as he explained
once in a candid moment, that the rosebud had
its own way.</p>

<p>Rosa's way was only passively, not actively
objectionable. All she asked was to be let
alone; allowed to paint undisturbed in her untidy
attic studio when the whim seized her,
and to lie in the hammock like a kitten, dozing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
the hours away when she did not choose to
exert herself. Occasionally she would have
spells of helpfulness, and for several days her
stool and box of colors would be set up beside
the parlor or dining-room doorway, while she
decorated the pannels with sprays of wistaria
and masses of fern, so true to nature that one
wondered where a little country girl had ever
learned to paint after such a manner.</p>

<p>One warm afternoon in early September she
was sitting on her stool in the hall, which ran
through the middle of the house from end to
end, putting slow, effective touches to a border
above the dado which she had begun in the
spring, and with characteristic indifference had
left unfinished until now. Caroline, just in
from a tour to the orchard, had thrown herself
down upon the settee to rest, and was exchanging
remarks with her mother about a certain
dress trimming which the elder lady had under
way when she suddenly broke off to exclaim:</p>

<p>"If there isn't Mr. Brent coming, and not a
speck of meat in the house! Now, I suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
I shall have to go to town to market. I should
think it was enough for him to be here every
Sunday and Wednesday, without dropping
upon us between whiles."</p>

<p>"Let Jessie kill a chicken," suggested Mrs.
Jones, soothingly.</p>

<p>"But you know he doesn't eat chickens. If
he was like any civilized American he would.
But nothing except a round of raw beef satisfies
his English appetite!"</p>

<p>But despite this small grumble, she smiled
cordially as a good-looking, middle-aged man
with a vigorous, florid face, set off by a pair of
heavy black whiskers, came briskly up the path
and included all of them in a general, informal
bow.</p>

<p>"Do you like omelet?" she asked reflectively,
as he took a seat near Rosa, and began
commenting upon her work with an easy censorship
which was evidently not disagreeable
to her.</p>

<p>He gave a little shudder. "'I'll no pullet
sperm in my brew,'" he quoted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I might have known you for a Falstaff,"
retorted Caroline, rising. "Well,
Mamma, I'm off."</p>

<p>"Not on my account, Miss Caroline. See
here, I've brought my animal diet with me,
knowing that you ladies subsist on tea and fruit
when I'm not about." And from his coat
pocket he drew a roll of brown paper, three-quarters
of a yard long, and held it out.</p>

<p>"Prime bologna," he added, complacently, as
both mother and daughter laughed heartily,
and Rosa turned to give one of her slow, sweet
smiles.</p>

<p>Brent was a "family friend." The major
had made his acquaintance at his club and
brought him home to dine one day when Rosa
was a winsome, tumbling baby; and although
he had grown grayer and stouter during the
years he had been coming out to the farm,
ostensibly to oversee Rosa's painting&mdash;for
which he never would hear of compensation&mdash;he
had not faltered in a certain purpose conceived
soon after that first visit, and as unsuspected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
by Mrs. Jones and her two elder
daughters as it was patent to Rosa herself.</p>

<p>There were some rare affinities between them,
even aside from their painting. Brent's British
phlegm was mellowed by a luxuriance of imagination
that he had inherited from an East
Indian mother. His temperament was a mixture
of vigor, warmth and languor; and while
he was not in the least degree adaptable, he
had a faculty of changing the atmosphere of a
company to suit himself; so that if others were
not pleased it seemed to be they, not he, who
was out of place. If they yielded up their individuality
to his, well and good; if not, they
dropped out of the talk; that was all. Brent
was a fluent and entertaining talker. He liked
to tell stories of tiger hunts and other jungle
pastimes; and Rosa, reclining with her dreamy
eyes half shut, liked to listen and feel herself
pleasantly thrilled and excited without other
necessity than to give up her mind to follow
where he led.</p>

<p>Her education had been desultory and superficial.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Brent had played the largest part in
it, and he had molded her nature at his pleasure
by catering to certain biases that he had perceived
to be unchangeable, and for the rest
giving her the side of life and affairs which he
preferred her to believe. What other experiences
he had had besides those he chose to tell
them, these innocent women neither conjectured
nor troubled themselves to inquire. It
was enough that he had been "the major's
friend."</p>

<p>He had lodgings in town, but his landlady
scarcely ever saw him; for when he was not
roaming around upon one of his sketching tours
he seemed to live in the Corcoran Art Gallery,
where Rosa painted under his superintendence
several hours each week. He had really devoted
himself to the girl's development with a
zeal beyond what would have appeared to be
necessary in the "family friend." Perhaps
Rosa thanked him in private, for she never did
so before the others. She treated him always
with the same indolent familiarity, and accepted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
his advice, his help and his devotion as a mere
matter of course; but she generally did as he
bade her.</p>

<p>This afternoon she continued to fill in her
charcoal outlines until she grew tired, and then,
dropping her brushes, slipped to a cushion and,
crossing her hands behind her head, leaned back
and looked up at him like a weary seraph.</p>

<p>"Lazy child," said Brent, smiling, and taking
her dropped brushes. "That stem is well done,
Rosa; but I want you to leave flowers for a
while and begin on that study of the nurse and
child. It is time for you to begin to think less
of technic and study the masters. I wish you
could go abroad now."</p>

<p>"You have made me think of nothing but
technic," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Certainly. There are many stages in art,
and that is the preliminary one. But you are
now to make an advance. How little you realize
your advantages. If I had your genius!"</p>

<p>"I realize one advantage&mdash;having you for a
teacher," she said in a low tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>The others had dropped away, and they were
by themselves.</p>

<p>Brent moved closer to her. "Have you
thought of what I talked to you about?"</p>

<p>"It's no use to talk about that; I rather
think they expect me to make a great match,
some time. Mamma wouldn't consider you
eligible, you know," she drawled, softly, with
smooth, matchless insolence.</p>

<p>Brent looked at her with an expression she
did not understand; but she never troubled
herself about what was beyond her easy comprehension.
And herein Brent had vastly the
advantage; he understood her to the depths of
her nature, and he knew perfectly that he had
made himself an essential part of her existence.
But he was wise enough to be patient. For
the present he allowed her to waive the subject
aside; nor did he betray even by the quiver of
an eyelash that she had wounded his self-love.
Indeed, their temperaments were much alike,
and neither one was troubled with sensitiveness.
Of the two the robust, mastiff-like man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
had more than the brown-eyed angel, who now
took to the hammock and left him to finish her
work; for it was as natural for him to work as
it was for her to be idle.</p>

<p>"You must get settled in town early this
fall," he said to the mother, when the family
had assembled again on the veranda after dinner.
"I have laid out a good winter's work
for Rosa at the gallery, and I want her to start
as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Mr. Brent, I admire your coolness," commented
Caroline. "If you expect Rosa to put
in a steady winter's work you must have suddenly
created a remarkable change in her."</p>

<p>"I really don't see how we are to go to town
at all this winter," said Mrs. Jones, wrinkling
her pretty forehead. "The Farleys haven't yet
positively pledged themselves to take the place,
as we depended on their doing; and of course
we can't go unless we let this house."</p>

<p>"Oh, the Farleys will take the place," said
Brent confidently. "And there is a nice little
house on "H" Street that will be vacant about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
the first of October. I wish you would go in
to-morrow and look at it."</p>

<p>"Give me the address," said Caroline. "I
have to go in town to-morrow, and I'll take a
peep at it. Then, if it seems worth while for
you to take the trouble, mamma dear, you can
go in next week."</p>

<p>"Only don't let it slip through your fingers,"
counseled Brent. "Rosa, don't you want to
take a little walk up the hill and see the sunset?"</p>

<p>"Get the wheelbarrow!" said Minnie, briskly.
"You'll never get Rosa to climb the hill."</p>

<p>But Brent continued to look smilingly at
Rosa, and, somewhat to their surprise, she got
up and went with him. As they began to
climb the gentle slope he took hold of her arm,
and she leaned against him with the same unconcern
with which she would have accepted
aid from one of her sisters. They were gone
half an hour, and when they came back a close
observer might have noted a satisfied look in
Brent's face. He had made a slight, very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
slight, advance in his plans, whatever they
were.</p>

<p>It was in accordance with them that the
family moved into the little house on "H"
Street within a fortnight. Every afternoon saw
Rosa seated before a Corot in the main gallery
of the Corcoran Art Building, and for at least
two hours she was busily occupied. Just how it
came about no one could have said. Perhaps
Rosa herself was not aware of the tightening
of a leash which had been woven securely
about her, and that had guided and now held
her to certain duties. Once, as he sat beside
her, painting away upon his small canvas with
those minute, exquisite touches which characterized
his style, Brent said, with some significance:</p>

<p>"You work very well under direction, Rosa;
but you wouldn't set a stroke if I were not
here, would you?"</p>

<p>She laughed, and turned her eyes upon him inquiringly.
"Wouldn't I?" she asked; "ah, well,
perhaps not. But then, you see, you <i>are</i> here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have grown so used to having me always
at hand, that you couldn't get on at all
without me, could you?"</p>

<p>"Get on without you?" she repeated.
"Why, I never thought of it."</p>

<p>The next day he let her think of it. For a
week he was absent on a sketching tour. When
he returned he discovered that she had taken a
vacation also; and then, for the first time in
her life, he said a few stern words to her. They
were very few, and without any hint of anger;
but the girl crimsoned, and opened her eyes
pathetically. Any other man would have been
self-condemned; but Brent, while instantly resuming
his usual manner, did not lessen the
effect of his rebuke; and from this time her
manner toward him began to undergo a change.
It was imperceptible to others, but apparent to
Brent. She was no longer so sweetly insolent
to him; she was more timid, more tractable;
and she attended more steadily to her work,
seeming to set a new value upon the praise of
which he had always been lavish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>The winter passed and the enervating air of
April crept over the city. One afternoon Rosa
threw down her brushes petulantly, exclaiming
that she could not make another stroke.</p>

<p>Brent quietly gathered her implements and
his own and stored them neatly away. Then
he laid his hand over hers and said, in a perfectly
matter-of-fact tone:</p>

<p>"Let's go and get married, Rosa?"</p>

<p>For a minute they looked at one another in
silence. Then her eyes dropped to her dress,
a pink print, fresh and crisp under the great
gray apron which she had begun to untie.</p>

<p>"What! In a calico dress?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, just as you are; and now."</p>

<p>"What will they say at home?"</p>

<p>"Think how much trouble we are going to
save your mother. We will tell them this
evening. Come, Rosa, I have been waiting for
you a good many years; don't keep me waiting
any longer."</p>

<p>"It is dreadfully absurd," she observed.
"What will you do with me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take you abroad next week, and when we
come back settle you down in the prettiest
little house you ever saw. I have bought one
up on Capitol Hill, and you shall be its little
mistress."</p>

<p>"I don't like housekeeping," remarked Rosa;
but she was walking with him toward the door.
Suddenly she stopped. "We can't get married
without a license, can we?"</p>

<p>"I have the license," said Brent, touching his
waistcoat pocket. "I got it yesterday."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," she said, pouting a little,
"You were rather premature. How did you
know I would have you?"</p>

<p>"I believed in my lucky star. We were
meant for each other, my dear."</p>

<p>She was silent after this. They walked half-a-dozen
squares and stopped before a house
next to a church. As Brent rang the bell he
saw that the girl was trembling slightly, and he
lost no time in getting her into the parlor,
where a puzzled minister came to them a moment
or so later. Brent explained and produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
the license. Rosa was nineteen and her father
was not living. There was no delay, and in
the presence of the minister's wife and daughter
(who took the bride for a pretty servant girl
and were condescending) the ceremony was
performed. But for the heavy ring that encircled
her finger the girl might have believed
that she was dreaming, as Brent drew her out
of the house again and hailed a passing horse-car
to take them to her mother's house.</p>

<p>Minnie opened the door, and through the
dusk her quick eyes perceived something unusual
in her sister; but Brent, giving her no
time for questions, drew his wife into the little
parlor, where the widow sat with her sewing.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Jones," he said calmly, "Rosa and I
are married." As she got up hastily, the color
rushing to her face, he added, "I believe my
old friend the major would not have refused to
give me his daughter."</p>

<p>It was a stroke of genius. Instead of uttering
the angry words upon her lips the widow
fell back upon her chair, crying. The major,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
dead, was not less the family oracle; and even
the girls, who had burst into exclamations, and
were not to be repressed for half an hour or so,
felt that, irregular and shocking as the affair
was, yet there was within it a grain of amelioration.</p>

<p>"But that she should have got married in a
sixpenny calico!" exclaimed Caroline, tearfully.
"I never shall get over that."</p>

<p>"I will buy her a gown or two in Paris," said
the new brother-in-law. "We shall sail next
week, and be gone a year, or perhaps longer."</p>

<p>But three years passed before the little house
on Capitol Hill had to be vacated by its tenant
in favor of the owners, who walked in upon
the Jones family one day, when the harvest
apples were ripe, and the two girls sat upon the
porch of the farm-house paring a bowlful of
them for supper.</p>

<p>"What is the change in Rosa?" mother and
sisters asked each other when the pair had gone
back to town the next morning. Mrs. Brent
was even more beautiful than she had been as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
a girl. She did not look unhappy. Yet there
was a difference.</p>

<p>The family found out what it meant when
they began to visit the little house in town.
Rosa had found another guide than her own
sweet will. She no longer idled the days away,
but sat patiently upon her little stool and
painted from morning till late in the afternoon,
while Brent&mdash;the personification of vigilance&mdash;hovered
about, pipe in mouth, seeing to the
thousand and one things about the house,
which, except for his superintendence, kept
itself, and dividing the rest of his attention
between Rosa's canvas and his own.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Caroline, indignantly,
"that Rosa&mdash;our lazy little Rosa&mdash;has made
fifteen hundred dollars the past year, while
Brent has only made three hundred?"</p>

<p>"That's what he married her for," said
Minnie, with a rapid inspiration. "I wondered
what impelled him. I thought it wasn't
love."</p>

<p>"My dear, he seems very fond of her," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
Mrs. Jones, divided between a wish to cry and
a wish to make the best of it.</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> fond of her," declared Caroline, "and
she's fond of him. But if ever a girl found a
master she has. He makes her work as I never
expected to see Rosa work. Not at housework,
dear me, no! She is not to waste her
precious strength on such things. She is to
devote herself to art, which is to make <i>her</i>
reputation and <i>his</i> living. That's all there is
to it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is not the worst thing that could
have happened to her," mused Minnie. "There
is a kind of nature that needs to be compelled
to make the best of itself."</p>

<p>"Don't you want some brute of an Englishman
to compel you to make the best of yourself?"
snapped Caroline.</p>

<p>"No," answered Minnie, quietly. "What
would do for Rosa would never suit me."</p>

<p>"Well, I think we had better go in and take
some peaches and straighten up that disorderly
house," said the elder sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>They found Rosa sitting absorbed over a
beautiful screen which was a piece of ordered
work, to cost a hundred and fifty dollars, while
Brent stood at the kitchen door, smoking
placidly as he contemplated a tableful of unwashed
dishes.</p>

<p>"Come in, sisters both," he said, gaily.
"But don't stop Rosa just now; she hates to
be interrupted when she is at work."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"And</span> who is that tall young man in the
store, who stood there as if nothing could induce
him to take his hands from his pockets?"</p>

<p>Miss Stretton's companion looked as if he
were mystified by her scornful tone. "That's
Albert Johnson," he answered in his matter-of-fact
way. "He's only been back hyar about
six months. A couple o' years ago he went
down to Texas and made about five hundred
dollars, and then, all to onct, he turned up
hyar again. He's nephew to old Johnson, and
stays in th' store, mostly."</p>

<p>"Doing what?" asked Miss Stretton, crisply.</p>

<p>"Why, doin' whatever's to do," answered
Jerry Douglas with his thin laugh. He was a
tall, bony youth, with gray eyes and a delicate
mouth. Although unformed and shy, there</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>
<p>was a hint of character about him; which was
the reason why Miss Stretton gave him the
honor of her company that morning on his
trip to Stoneyton. It was partly in pursuance
of her amiable wish to draw him out, and partly
because she liked the ride on horseback. She
was usually talkative, but now they ambled
along the dusty pike in silence.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;I jest thought of it, Miss Julia," Jerry
said suddenly. "Old Johnson's got a nice
horse he might let you have. Bert's been
ridin' it since he come back, but he can't want
it all th' time. I'll see if I kin git it fur you,
if you say so."</p>

<p>"Of course I say so, Jerry," retorted Miss
Stretton, coming out of her brown study and
turning her bright blue eyes upon him.
"And why didn't you think of it before? But
I know it takes you Virginia young men a long
time."</p>

<p>Young Douglas laughed again uneasily. "I
s'pose we're ruther backward compared to th'
men you know, but you must recollect we've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
been under a cloud since th' war. We haven't
got eddication, and consequently we feel at a
disadvantage. Me, now, I've been to school,
but what do I know? Th' only thing's fur me
to go ter Texas."</p>

<p>"Yes, and make a little money and come
back again and loaf around till it is spent,"
commented the girl inwardly. But she said
aloud, "Don't be disheartened, Jerry. It isn't
what we know that counts; it's what we do."</p>

<p>"What I want t' do is t' make money," Jerry
muttered; "only th' people home won't let me
go 'way."</p>

<p>"Your time will come if you don't give up,
never fear," she returned kindly, as they rode
up to the stile and he awkwardly helped her
off the great plow-horse.</p>

<p>She stood at the gate for a minute, watching
the angular, boyish figure lead the horse to the
stable, heard the rough but not unkindly, "Go
in thar, now, Victor&mdash;stand, sir!" And then
all was still.</p>

<p>In front of the low frame-house was a small,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
trim garden, with two beds of red geranium
bordered by bits of whitened oyster-shells.
Behind, lay the fields; to the left, the stable,
pig-sty and orchard. On the right, was an unkempt
bit of woods, thick with undergrowth.
Some day they were going to cut out that undergrowth,
which obstructed the fine view of
the hills beyond.</p>

<p>"Some day," mused Miss Stretton, "great
things are to be done!" And yet she was not
without pity as she contemplated the few acres
of worn-out land, the meager cattle, the small,
uncertain fruit-crop which made the living of
the worthy lady, Mrs. Douglas, and her sluggish,
semi-invalid husband. This summer they
had for the first time followed the example of
their neighbors and augmented their income
by taking two summer boarders; there was not
room for more.</p>

<p>Two or three days went by, and Jerry had
apparently done nothing about the horse.
Miss Stretton's dearest wish was to hire an
animal on which she might take her daily rides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
with credit to herself and less jarring of her
bones. The great beast now at her service
resembled some creature in process of transformation
to some other species, so shambling,
so long-mouthed, so ashamed of his own appearance
did he seem. But, rendered desperate
by Jerry's procrastination, she mounted Prince
one morning and turned toward the village.</p>

<p>"You have shaken me to pieces&mdash;you,
Prince!" she said reproachfully as she stopped
him in front of the store.</p>

<p>Stoneyton was perhaps the very smallest village
ever dignified by the name. There was a
church, the store, and two neighboring houses,
one beside the store and one just across the
narrow street. Two swaying elms almost covered
this space with their low-hanging branches,
and a broken wagon shaft lying in the way
made it difficult for a vehicle to turn there. A
cart and horse now stood in the road, its driver
absent. There was, for a rarity, no one on the
stoop; all was unusually still; and Miss Stretton,
waiting impatiently until the driver should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
come out and start off, leaving the road again
a thoroughfare, sat still on her tall steed, and
let her eyes roam dreamily around on the well-known
but ever-pleasing landscape.</p>

<p>The customer came out, and with her came
young Mr. Johnson, who stowed away her parcels,
helped her into the wagon, and handed
her the reins before he turned to the pretty
girl with a tinge of color still dyeing his brown
cheek.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;your uncle in?" asked Miss Stretton
sweetly.</p>

<p>He was very sorry, but his uncle had gone
to Port Royal that morning to see a sick sister.
Could he do anything for her?</p>

<p>"Well," she said, hesitating, "I suppose you
might do just as well, only&mdash;I had expected to
talk with your uncle."</p>

<p>Young Johnson looked puzzled but admiring.
It was the admiration in his splendid
dark eyes that embarrassed her. To the city
girls who came up to the mountain every one
of these little country stores, and every farm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
which boasted a son or two of some old, impoverished
family, furnished an escort to dances
and picnics, and the beau of a summer. Miss
Stretton was not exempt from girlish weaknesses,
and as the handsome countryman stood
there waiting for her probable order for ribbons
or candy or stationery, she wished that
she could settle her little matter of business
with some one else.</p>

<p>But she took it like a douche at last, all at
once. "Jerry told me that your uncle has a
nice riding-horse, and I want one for a month
or so. Would he hire it? Could I arrange
the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Well, the horse is mine, in fact. Uncle
made a present of it to me," explained Albert,
kicking a little stone in the road.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the young lady. The affair was
now a nuisance to both of them. For her
part, she felt that, if she proceeded, there must
ensue some pecuniary loss in the transaction;
she must be large and uncalculating. On the
other hand, Albert shrank from the mention of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
dollars and cents, although if the matter had
been conducted through a third party, he would
not have hesitated to make something out of
the Yankee girl. Being a Virginian, he could
not now put a cool, business face upon it. It
occurred to him that he would like to drive her
down to the hop at Berryville to-morrow night.
How would it look to make bargains before
tendering an invitation!</p>

<p>He looked up and down the road; the soft
breeze from over the hills just rustled the
leaves, the low grunt of a porker reached their
ears from around the house, a dog barked
somewhere, but no figure disturbed the scene;
nobody was coming, they must talk it out.</p>

<p>"Well?" she interrogated impatiently. She
looked very graceful and saucy. He glanced
upward and caught her fleeting smile.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Miss Stretton," he said
with the relief of an inspiration, "you mustn't
make bargains in the dark. Try my Sultana
to-morrow, and if she goes to suit you, we'll
talk further."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Johnson, and I'm extremely
obliged to you." She was grateful for the suggestion;
Jerry should be messenger next time.</p>

<p>They were now at ease and could look one
another frankly in the face. Each knew the
other well by hearsay. Who did not know of
the Johnson family, who had lived on the same
fine old place for a hundred years and more?
And to which of the inquisitive natives was the
affable young lady a stranger when she had
been staying for a fortnight at the Douglas
farm? It was quite conventional for them to
call each other by name and to linger a few
minutes talking.</p>

<p>She rode off finally, with a charming smile,
and Albert went into the dingy store whistling,
with his hands in his pockets; handsome and
lazy, and with nothing better to do than to recline
on the counter and recollect each detail of
the conversation.</p>

<p>The next morning he made taking the horse
over an excuse for a call, and obtained her promise
to go with him to the hop. Every one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
went; the road was gay with vehicles of every
description, and on the ten-mile drive there and
back their acquaintance grew old. If Miss
Stretton knew how to talk, Albert could listen
eloquently.</p>

<p>Afterward she tried to recall something sensible
and original in his talk, which would
account for the pleasure she had taken in his
company, but there was nothing in her memory
save confused impressions of what he must
have meant.</p>

<p>"What a shame," she said to herself vehemently,
"for a young man of intelligence and
versatility&mdash;he knows many things and could
know more if he tried&mdash;to be playing fifth
wheel to a coach on a stupid country road&mdash;clerk
in that little store which a girl of twelve
could manage alone!"</p>

<p>And as soon as the chance came, she told
him this, indirectly, and with many a friendly
ameliorating glance. Albert took her lecture
meekly. It came one morning when they were
riding together. She had found Sultana delightful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
and he had made a joking bargain, letting
her ride if he might ride with her when
he had time and his mother's horse could be
spared from the farm. And so this little matter
was adjusted without any reference to money.</p>

<p>It was rare pleasure to the city girl to gallop
over the open country of a fair August morning
before the sun grew red; the fresh breeze
from the Blue Ridges colored her cheeks and
lighted up her eyes, while it filled her mind
with longings, arousing her energy.</p>

<p>"It is energy that you young men lack," she
admonished him in a sweet, deferential tone.
"Energy! Chalk it up on the fences, and spell
it out as you saunter along these dull little
country lanes."</p>

<p>Albert thought best to treat it as a joke, but
that only made her more earnest. Then he
changed his tactics, and met the reproach by
a degree of pathetic admission that unsettled
her.</p>

<p>She found it a fascinating pastime to chide
this handsome idler for making little use of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
abilities and she longed to be able to exert a
strongly stimulating influence. But when he
told her that, on the whole, he enjoyed his life
as it was and had no wish to change it, that
there was virtue in contentment and that he
appreciated his lot, much as she seemed to
despise it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I didn't say I despised it!" she exclaimed,
abashed, her airy ambitions seeming for an instant
less grand. But when she looked at her
young Alcibiades, lost in the luxury of peace,
she pined to send him forth among men to do
battle for the things men care to win. And
yet the girl had such tact that her touch did
not irritate. The young Southerner felt her
thrilling tones move him pleasantly; she cooled
his languid breath like a fresh North wind coming
in the summer heat. Throughout, his face
wore the same look of rich, indolent peace.
One day, however, he opened his splendid, dark
eyes wide, and asked her just what she would
have a man do to prove himself a man.</p>

<p>Miss Stretton was as vague and inexperienced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
as women usually are who urge extraordinary
feats upon men in whom they are interested.
But not to seem foolish, she took the matter
into consideration.</p>

<p>"I'll give you time," he said, laughing when
she hesitated, "but&mdash;you have been so hard on
me, Miss Julia, that I really must press the
question home."</p>

<p>After this she listened to the reports about
him, and heard much of his sweet temper under
provocation&mdash;to which, she owned, she herself
could testify&mdash;of his kindness of heart, his
courage, his goodness to his feeble mother.
The country people relied upon him; his moral
character was spotless. Yet, even while she
learned to admire him, she was not satisfied.
Seeing her gem thus proved real, made her
the more determined to bring out its luster.</p>

<p>His question was carried gravely in her mind,
and she forbore to resume the subject until
she could say something wise and practical.</p>

<p>They met often, there were so many affairs
during the summer to bring them together,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
hops, drives, and picnics, and then the camp-meetings,
which brought out all the county.
She saw him sometimes in attendance on his
mother there, always gentlemanly and good,
where the other boys were openly rowdy. She
saw him in the store, always patient with the
freaks of customers and with the cross humors
of his uncle.</p>

<p>And one day she met him (and her heart was
touched) carrying along the road a little crying
child, whose bare toes were crinkled up with
the hurt from a sharp stone. The ragamuffin
sat perched upon the broad shoulder and
peered down at the lady with eyes of cerulean
blue. He hugged his friend a little closer but
with undiminished confidence. Albert colored
slightly, but walked along beside the stylish
girl without apologizing for his burden.</p>

<p>"Can't I do something for the little fellow?"
she asked gently, and being used to children (she
was a school teacher), she saw in a minute what
the matter was, and taking from her purse a
piece of court-plaster, she made Albert set him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
down while she applied it to the cut. If her
fingers shrank from the dirty little foot neither
of her watchers saw it.</p>

<p>"There, little man, does that feel better?"</p>

<p>"I wants ter b' toted," said the urchin, irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Albert, shouldering him
again. "Didn't I promise to carry you clear
home? But if the lady had done something
for me, I'd have thanked her, heh?"</p>

<p>But the child's face expressed only a vacant
sort of contentment.</p>

<p>And they all went on together until they
reached a poor house where a woman stood at
the door, looking anxiously up and down the
road. As her boy was brought to her, she
caught him up, with a shake and a kiss delivered
simultaneously.</p>

<p>"That's jus' like ye, Albert," she said gruffly.
"I've been ter'ble worried fur th' past hour&mdash;feared
he'd got runned over. Yer ma well?"</p>

<p>"Middling, thank you, Mrs. Smithers."</p>

<p>Then he rubbed his handkerchief over his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
forehead and asked Miss Stretton if she was
going "to town" this hot day.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm trying to walk off a restless fit, and
I have a letter to mail."</p>

<p>"Better give that to me. See, I've picked
up three or four along the road and got half-a-dozen
commissions&mdash;hope I shan't forget 'em."</p>

<p>"Are you general errand-boy?" she demanded
impatiently.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't want me to be unneighborly?
Besides," he added with a twinkle in
his eye, "I thought you found fault with me
for not being useful!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not in that way. Don't you suppose
I see that you are useful here, that everybody
likes you and depends upon you&mdash;but it
is such a waste of yourself to be busied with
such little things&mdash;there are larger places to be
filled elsewhere&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And larger men to fill them," he said seriously.
"There ain't as much to me as you
suppose. It seems to me my place is here,
right in this little sleepy village. I can be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
help to my uncle and to others, and my mother
can't do without me."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried sharply. This was a stumbling-block
she had to recognize. Yet she found
that he hardly understood her. She wanted to
stir him up to discontent with himself and his
surroundings, so that he might be led to enlarge
his mental outlook. The thing was for
him first to become enlightened, aspiring, superior
to his friends&mdash;action would follow.</p>

<p>Although it is hard for a man to follow the
rapid deviations of a woman's mind, yet the
most phlegmatic have their moments of insight.
Miss Stretton had revealed a great deal
more than she was aware to the young countryman,
and he was less dull than he seemed. It
came to him that there was something that he
wanted to say, but all his ideas grew confused
as he thought. He looked around with an
uncertain, wistful gaze. He was only a poor
man, surrounded by commonplace, meager
things; advantages had been lacking to him;
perhaps, as she had said, he had not improved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
his chances. And yet it seemed to him that
he had done his duty.</p>

<p>"I know our farmers' lives up here must
seem mean to you," he said slowly, "poor and
small. You think we might do more and make
more out of ourselves. Well, maybe we might.
I think that, after a while, we'll find new things
to do. I thought once I'd strike out, and I
went to Texas. But can you fancy what life
is down there among the cattle-drovers? I
couldn't stand it, Miss Stretton. I didn't love
money well enough to sink myself quite so
low. And so I came back. Maybe you think
I lay 'round a heap, but I do all that comes in
my way, and somebody'd have to do it. If I
was ambitious, I s'pose I'd want to be something
else besides a country storekeeper, but it
seems to me there's more love in my heart for
this poor land and for my neighbors than for
anything else. I'm not of a restless disposition,
and yet I've got my share of pride. I'm
not old yet,"&mdash;the fine figure straightening a
little, involuntarily&mdash;"and maybe after a while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
something else will come to me that I can
do."</p>

<p>"And you are content to wait for it&mdash;the
chance&mdash;to come, are you?" she asked, bending
her earnest gaze upon him.</p>

<p>"I won't quote the only bit of Milton I remember,
but I believe I serve a useful purpose
even while I wait for promotion&mdash;that is, what
you think promotion."</p>

<p>The girl was silenced. She could not exactly
understand how a man could be like this, yet
in the midst of her defeat was a feeling of
triumph in him. Through the <i>far niente</i> her
energetic mind had so despised there came the
gleam of a fine thought, a real purpose, before
which her woman's nature bowed, rejoicing.
Obeying a common impulse, they lingered in
the lane.</p>

<p>"They need a new teacher in this district,"
said Albert abruptly, and looking full at her.
"If it is your mission to put energy into us,
why not begin the missionary work there?
Take the boys young."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>She had no reply to this but a look of reproach.
He had put away her friendship for
himself, he recommended her to other matters.
Tacitly, he implied that she was incapable of
the sacrifice involved in his suggestion. It was
ironical.</p>

<p>She turned to walk on, but Albert started
and caught her hand. "Don't be angry, Miss
Julia! I only meant that it would be less
dangerous with them than it has been with me.
I&mdash;I am more stirred than you would like me
to be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His blazing eyes transfixed her. For an
instant she stared, then drew her hand away
and put it up to her face.</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued brokenly, "I know it's
no use to speak, you couldn't condescend to
this paltry existence&mdash;you want the fulness
and brightness of the city,&mdash;the company of an
educated man. There isn't anything about me
that's fit to associate with you. Well? I must
beg pardon, I s'pose, and yet I couldn't forbear
letting you know that, while you've been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
trying to put some vim into the lazy country
fellow, you've waked up his heart, at least."</p>

<p>Miss Stretton uncovered her face. They
confronted one another&mdash;the bright, sweet girl,
the handsome youth, aglow with passion.</p>

<p>The land was poverty-stricken, the promise
small, but there was freshness, beauty, peace all
about. "He is good, he is noble," she thought.
There crept into her face something that amazed
him, but he did not stop to wonder at it. He saw
fortune sweeping down a shower of gold at his
feet, and it was no time to question her beneficence.
By a step he lessened the little distance
between them, and the two shadows melted
into one along the sunny lane.</p>

<p>"You are far brighter than I, Julia," he murmured
after a while, "though your reasoning
has never moved me any. But if you love
me!&mdash;I think you will do whatever you wish
with me."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean this, at all," she returned,
her lovely face sparkling with tears and smiles
both at once. In her heart she felt that it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
her nature, not his, which the future might
change.</p>

<p>Yet, when they concluded to walk on to the
store, she looked about with a sense of responsibility
and an eye to changes to come, while
he&mdash;his face flushed with happiness&mdash;lounged
beside her in the old indolent way&mdash;unreproved.</p>

<h2><a name="APPLE_BLOSSOMS" id="APPLE_BLOSSOMS">APPLE BLOSSOMS</a>
<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the clean, large kitchen of a Virginia
farm-house sat an old woman alone, knitting.
She had been pretty once; fifty years ago that
wrinkled yellow skin had been called "creamy,"
and the scant gray hair drawn back under the
plain cap had been a shower of brown curls.
And she had coquetted with Judge Holt and
turned away from him at the last to marry plain
Nathan Bennett, living with him in rare contentment
for two-score years, and then coming
to spend the remnant of her days with her
daughter Ann. Now Ann, too, was gone, and
only the children were left; Ben and Nancy,
and her own adopted child, Lura Ann.</p>

<p>She smoothed down her neat gray cashmere
gown, which had been her "second best" dress
since Ann's death, and leaned back more comfortably</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>
<p>against the cushioned surface of the
splint rocking-chair.</p>

<p>"They're good children," she said to herself,&mdash;"excepting
Nancy. And she's not so bad
as might be." She cast a satisfied glance at
the meadows and fields stretching as far as her
eyes could reach, and then looked lovingly at
the dwarf apple-trees whose branches pressed
against the window-shutters. Some of the pink
blossoms lay on the ledge. It was May. The
flies were buzzing, the sparrows twittering, as
they stole cotton from the body of a doll lying
in the yard and flew up to the roof with it.</p>

<p>A little girl came around the house and picked
up the doll, shook it, looked up at the eaves
where the mother sparrow sat, muttered something
in an angry tone, and entered the house,
singing. She sang: "The apples were ripe
and beginning to fall, beginning to fall!"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said her grandmother, "you'll see
the apples fall a many times, but I shall scarcely
see 'em more'n once more&mdash;once or twice more,
at most. Well, well, I'll be contented to die
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
if only I can live to see my boy and Lura Ann&mdash;&mdash;"
then she stopped, meeting the child's
bright eyes.</p>

<p>"Lura Ann is going to marry Sackford Moss,"
said the child.</p>

<p>An angry flush came over the old woman's
thin face; she jerked her knitting, and one of
her needles fell to the floor.</p>

<p>"Now you're mad, granny, and it's wicked
to be mad, so I shan't hand you your knitting-needle,"
sang the little girl, in a silvery voice.</p>

<p>"Then you'll have no stockings to wear when
the biting frost comes; but you don't care&mdash;you
don't care. 'Tis a generation that thinks
not of the future, but works its will in the present,"
moaned the old woman, folding her hands
together hard.</p>

<p>"I'll hand you your needle if you'll tell Lura
Ann to make waffles for supper," said the sharp
child; but her grandmother looked upon her
with disfavor and did not reply. After a moment
the little girl came quietly forward and
laid the needle on her lap, but the old woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
did not resume her knitting. She sat with her
hands folded, and looked at intervals out of
the window, but with a much-wrinkled brow.</p>

<p>A door opened, and Lura Ann came in with
a wide straw hat on. She was tall, slim, and
fair, with deep gray eyes, heavy-lidded and
long-lashed, and a little red mouth whose short
upper lip just raised itself enough to give a
glimpse of small, pearly teeth. She looked shy
and sweet.</p>

<p>"I am going to town, grandaunt," she said,
timidly. "Shall I bring you some more
yarn?"</p>

<p>The old woman straightened herself and
looked sternly at the maiden. "Be you a-going
to marry Sackford Moss?" she asked shrilly.</p>

<p>The pretty lips closed together, and no answer
came from them.</p>

<p>"She's going to buy her wedding-gown now,"
cried the child, getting up quickly from her
stool. "Say, Lura Ann, can I go with you?"</p>

<p>"You stay right hyar, Nancy, and take care
of granny," said Lura Ann, with some severity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
Then she went out, murmuring to herself:
"They all think the same thing."</p>

<p>She walked steadily out through the front
gate and along the road to town. It was two
miles distant, and the air was close and dusty.
Her little black shoes were soon specked, and
the hem of her dress gathered soil by dipping
against them. The blue merino scarf over her
shoulders made her too warm, but she did not
dare take it off, because it covered a large patch
under her arm.</p>

<p>A handsome road-wagon, drawn by a pair of
bay horses, dashed up suddenly beside her.
The driver leaned forward and touched his hat
with an air of devotion.</p>

<p>"Just in time, Lura Ann," he cried, gaily.
"Come, get in, and I'll drive you to town and
wherever else you want to go."</p>

<p>"No, I thank you," said Lura Ann.</p>

<p>But he got down and urged her cordially.
The high, shaded seat looked delightful. The
fine horses tossed their heads and pawed impatiently.
The long road stretched out, hot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
and dusty. Walking she would get to town
looking like a fright, and it would take much
longer. The last consideration had a weight
known to nobody but herself. She let Sackford
help her up into the seat and draw the
linen duster over her knees. Covertly he examined
her dress.</p>

<p>"Going to shop?" he asked; adding carelessly:
"Burns has got in quite a lot of new
goods. My sisters were in last week and
bought a carriage load. But they are nothing
to what is in the city. I am going to the city
soon. Emily has been teasing me to buy her
a lace dress. How pretty you would look in a
lace dress, Lura Ann, with a little lace bonnet
on your soft brown hair, trimmed with rosebuds
just the color of your lips!"</p>

<p>Lura Ann's cheeks grew pinker than the
bunch of apple blossoms at her throat. "Your
sisters and I air different people," she said, in
her plaintive, soft voice.</p>

<p>Sackford feasted his eyes in the blush. The
veins in his short, thick neck began to swell,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
and he shifted the reins to his right hand and
laid the left across the back of the seat. But
Lura Ann sat up very straight.</p>

<p>"Lean back and be comfortable," he urged.</p>

<p>"Take away your arm then, please," faltered
Lura Ann. And just then Ben Falconer, coming
across a field in his coarse working clothes,
saw her drooping with the blush upon her
cheek and Sackford's arm about her waist.
He stood still, and looked after the handsome
team with a frown and a sigh. Lura Ann had
not seen him, but Sackford had, and secretly
blessed the hour. Yet he did not dare kiss
Lura Ann, as he had intended.</p>

<p>"Where shall I take you first?" he asked,
as they entered the town.</p>

<p>"To Mr. Wright's, if you please."</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;he holds some little money belonging
to her, I've heard," thought Sackford.</p>

<p>"Don't wait for me," she said, but he waited,
and she was gone a long time. When she came
out she was pale, as if she had been worried.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
Yet she looked resolute, and spoke in a tone
that had lost all its timidity.</p>

<p>"Take me to the old red brick house at the
end of the street," she said, eagerly, "and oh
be quick!"</p>

<p>"Why, what's the attraction in that old
rookery&mdash;a new milliner?" jested Sackford.
He could not conceive the idea of a woman's
being interested in anything but clothes.</p>

<p>Lura Ann's slim hand closed tightly under
her shawl about the old purse that had come
out empty and was now full to bursting with
currency. Five hundred dollars! She was of
age to-day, and had drawn it in her own name,
every cent. Milliner! Yes, her hat was shabby,
but no matter about that.</p>

<p>Sackford was smiling to himself at her excitement
as he helped her out on to the stone
step before the old red brick house. She rang
the bell, and there was no response. Her
courage seemed to be oozing away as she
waited.</p>

<p>"Better come back," called Sackford. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
she shook her head and applied herself to the
bell again. After a moment a shuffling step
approached and the door opened a few inches,
allowing a man's head to be seen. He was old
and grim-looking. Lura Ann said something
low and timidly, and after a look of keen scrutiny
he let her in.</p>

<p>Sackford felt an indescribable reluctance to
have her go in.</p>

<p>After about five minutes she appeared at the
door with a paper in her hand, and beckoned
him. He sprang out quickly, tied his horses,
and stepped into the hall beside her.</p>

<p>"Oh, please see if that is all right," she
entreated, putting a legal paper in his hand.
"You are a lawyer, and <i>he</i>&mdash;this gentleman,
said to let you see it."</p>

<p>Sackford glanced from it to her, saw her total
unconsciousness of anything out of the way,
frowned, bit his lip, and examined the document
with care.</p>

<p>"It is all right," he then said. "It is a full
release. Is this what you want?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes, thank you! and I am much
obliged to you, sir," she added, sweetly, to the
grim old man who stood looking on from the
background.</p>

<p>He bowed sardonically. "The obligation is
on my side, young lady," he said.</p>

<p>"By Jove! It is on somebody else's side,"
thought Sackford, as he put Lura Ann back
into the vehicle; adding, aloud, "I don't like
this."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you don't know," said Lura Ann,
pleadingly. Her long lashes grew moist. "It
is the wish of grandaunt's heart to have the
farm free from this mortgage. I always felt as
if the debt had been made because of me. She
took me when father died&mdash;I was a tiny child
of three&mdash;and oh, they have always been so
good to me!"</p>

<p>Sackford's frown did not soften. It was surprising
how surly his shrewd, coarse face became.
"But whose <i>is</i> the farm?" he asked.
"That release was made out to Ben Falconer."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it is just the same. Grandaunt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
made over her share of the farm to him, and
he cares for all of us. He is the best man in
the world&mdash;my cousin Ben."</p>

<p>"The world&mdash;what do you know of the
world?" said Sackford. "But, see here, Lura
Ann, do you understand? You have given
away all your little fortune and left yourself
penniless."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lura Ann, simply. There was
something in her face that checked further
speech upon his part. She was a foolish, improvident
child, and rather too confiding toward
this cousin Ben of hers, but she was very
pretty&mdash;wonderfully pretty&mdash;and, after all, he
had money enough. If five hundred dollars
had rid her of her sense of obligation, the price
was cheap. A sigh came here, for Sackford
Moss did not love to part with money. But
feeling that he had better put this subject out
of his mind, he smoothed his face and tried to
regain his former jovial, easy bearing. Lura
Ann heard his talk as if it sounded from a far-off
country. But suddenly there was a question;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
it brought her with a start to a sense of
her surroundings. His face was bent down
close to hers; his breath&mdash;she shuddered and
turned her head. Then the answer came, clear
and final. What could he do after that but
whip up the horses and hasten on?</p>

<p>At the farm gate he let her down and drove
away without a backward glance. A spray of
withered apple blossoms fell from her dress into
the dust, and his wheel passed over it.</p>

<p>But she walked up the path with a step like
the toss of thistledown and a heart as light.</p>

<p>The old woman was again looking from the
window. She nodded kindly, but her brow
was careworn. "Nancy laid the fire," she said.
"It's five o'clock. I think it's going to rain.
Ben has worked too hard lately. He's in his
room with a headache."</p>

<p>"I'll get tea in a minute," said Lura Ann.
"But first, grandaunt, look hyar!" She laid
off her hat and scarf, and came and knelt on
the stool at the old woman's feet. "See," and
she opened the paper. "It is a release from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
the mortgage! It is my gift to you, grandaunt,
bought with the money uncle left me.
The farm is free!"</p>

<p>The old woman's hands trembled as she laid
them on the beautiful young head. "The
Lord bless you, child!" she murmured. But
in a moment came the after-thought. "Lura
Ann, it has taken everything!" she exclaimed.
"You haven't a dollar left to buy your wedding-gown!"</p>

<p>The stair door opened, and Ben came down
from his room, carrying a little hand-mirror in
a carved wooden frame. He was a fine specimen
of young manhood, tall, straight, and
strong. His dark brown eyes showed intelligence
and depth of feeling. Over his features&mdash;naturally
good&mdash;was now cast the reflection
of that victory which makes a man "greater
than he that taketh a city." He advanced with
an air of cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"Lura Ann, I did not forget that this is
your birthday. I carved this frame for you
myself, and I wish you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ben!" cried his grandmother. "Lura
Ann has bought off the mortgage!"</p>

<p>"And I'm going to light the fire with it,"
cried Lura Ann a little tremulously, and springing
up.</p>

<p>But Ben came and took it from her quickly.
He did not comprehend the legal phrases as
Sackford had done, but he gathered the sense.
His fine eyes began to brighten and glow as
they rested on his cousin's face, now averted
and blushing.</p>

<p>"Lura Ann, let me see your wedding-gown,"
exclaimed Nancy, coming in; and Lura Ann
grew rose red, but she made a violent effort to
free herself from this wretched mistake.</p>

<p>"I haven't got any&mdash;I'm not going to have
any!" she cried hysterically, turning to strike
a match to the fire. "What do I want of a
wedding-gown when I'm not going to be
married?"</p>

<p>"But Sackford Moss said&mdash;&mdash;" began Nancy,
with staring eyes.</p>

<p>"Bother Sackford Moss!" said Lura Ann,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
pettishly, trembling with nervousness under
Ben's grave eyes.</p>

<p>"He said he was going to take you away
from us!" finished the persistent child.</p>

<p>"Well, he isn't!" said Lura Ann emphatically.
Then she would have liked to flee to her
room, but Ben was still standing before her.</p>

<p>"Nancy," he said, in singularly happy tones,
"go, get in the young chickens, quick. Don't
you see how fast the rain is coming?" And
Nancy, who always obeyed her brother, went.</p>

<p>Then Ben, conscious of the whole evening
before him, let Lura Ann get supper and clear
it away, before supplementing by a single word
the tender, hopeful look in his eyes.</p>

<p>But an hour later, when the shower had
passed, they stood together on the stoop, which
was covered with fallen apple blossoms. The
clouds were gone and the sky was clear blue,
except for a trail of gold in the west. The
fields lay green and wet. They looked at sky
and fields, and at last into each other's eyes,
and there their gaze rested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p>"How sweet the air is after the rain," said
the old woman.</p>

<p>"It is the apple blossoms," said Ben, from
the stoop; and gathering up a handful he let
them fall in a shower over Lura Ann's head.</p>
